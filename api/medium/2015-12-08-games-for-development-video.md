Often times the notion of human development gets lost in a swirling vortex of tedious administrative processes that people have to wade through. Although humans are invested in changing and improving their communities, the methods used to reel them in lack a certain element. *Games for Development*aims to fill in that gap.

In partnership with UNDP in Moldova, Egypt, and Bhutan, the Engagement Lab is happy to announce this exciting initiative to bring about positive change in society._ Games for Development_ taps into the power of play to engage people in critical real world processes. “We’re shifting the conversation about play,” says Sam Liberty, senior game designer. “Play is something fundamental; it’s what makes us human. Our philosophy at the Lab is that games and playful interventions have an important part to play in the future of development.” The sometimes messy process of play can be used to help people tackle serious parts of life. _Games for Development_ will make work meaningful, gratifying, and engaging.

The next step in this process will take Sam, Lab Managing Director Mariko Davidson, and Lab Director Eric Gordon to Egypt for a games development workshop to teach these principles and spread the philosophy of games for development through the region.
