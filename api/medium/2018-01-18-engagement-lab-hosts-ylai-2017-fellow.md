Over the course of four weeks, the Engagement Lab hosted **Charles Hutson**, a civic tech entrepreneur and a high school IT teacher, as a YLAI fellow through [the 2017 Professional Fellows Program](https://ylai.state.gov/fellowship/).

YLAI fellows enhance their professional development skills at organizations across the US, and apply this knowledge to their home countries. Charles develops mobile and web applications for startups and NGOs.

Charles has a passion for innovation and education, and a desire to drive change in high-poverty regions through literacy and technology. He started a tech solutions business in Guyana called HFN Solutions that includes ECAB, a platform similar to UBER that provides easy transportation to community members.

Charles aims to provide startups with means to create affordable applications and foster an environment of inclusion in the tech market. He wants to revolutionize the Guyanese economy and help as many students as he can.

During his time at the Engagement Lab, Charles focused on prototyping a platform to not only educate the Guyanese communities about suicide prevention, but also, to reduce Guyanaâ€™s massive suicide rate.
