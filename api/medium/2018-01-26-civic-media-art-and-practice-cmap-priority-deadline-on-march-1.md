The Engagement Lab at Emerson College is accepting applications for our **Master of Arts degree program Civic Media: Art and Practice (CMAP)** for Fall 2018. **The priority deadline to apply is March 1st, 2018.** After this date, we’ll start accepting students on a rolling basis and awarding scholarships for the program.

We’re seeking interdisciplinary minded students and recent graduates who are scholars, entrepreneurs, socially engaged artists, civic leaders, and creative technologists to apply. We would love your help reaching anyone who is looking to refine their skills and position themselves more strongly in the field of civic media.

The core experience and outcomes of the 12-month CMAP program are centered around thesis projects. These creative works highlight the relationship of media, art, and practice and explore a wide range of approaches to the art & design of civic media, including participatory digital campaigns, mobile apps, public art installations, interactive curriculums, and virtual platforms. These projects bring to life the theories and practices that CMAP students explore in coursework throughout the year.

Alumni of CMAP are well positioned for the growing field of scholarship and applied work in civic media, including employment opportunities in government, community media, public media, non-governmental organizations, digital agencies, and cultural organizations. Past graduates of CMAP currently work in various job sectors and organizations where they apply the skills and knowledge gained from the program, including the Obama Foundation, Global Family Research Project, Harvard Kennedy School, and more.
