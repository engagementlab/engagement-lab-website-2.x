# David Weinberger Asks: Is The Internet Disappointed In Us?

### By Engagement Lab (**Roma Dash)**

11/18/2015

Last Monday, as part of an Engagement Lab sponsored event, a packed theater of Emerson students were visited by [David Weinberger,](http://weinberger.org/) a prominent Internet thinker and American technologist, Co-director of Harvard’s [Library Innovation Lab](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/), Co-author of the best-selling book, [The Cluetrain Manifesto](http://www.cluetrain.com/), and an overall fan of everything that is the Internet.

“You open your dad’s glove box,” Weinberger said during the talk, “and you’ll find a map that was folded multiple times and a best of Abba CD that never goes away.”

His point was that the map provides the reader with a restricted amount of information. People can’t interact with the paper, can’t ask for shortcuts, can’t search for traffic density. Unlike smartphones or tablets; unlike the beauty of Internet.

He spoke for about 2 hours, followed by a Q&A session. The talk explained how his generation perfected ice cream and how the current one must perfect the Internet — must fight for its survival, its continuous improvement, and to ensure that it remains free and not hijacked by corporate pricing policies.

Weinberger, who has been published in a variety of journals including _Wired_, CNN.com, and _The Atlantic_, says the Internet has the power to shape us.

Many students who attended the talk mentioned that this was a refreshing change. A man coming in to tell them that no, the Internet isn’t evil, it is not killing everyone’s soul — in fact, it is quite the opposite.

The Internet helps connect people, lets them share ideas and link to events across the globe. A hashtag can spark a revolution or help people in times of need (1). The current generation, Weinberger said, has a responsibility to make sure that there are no more unnecessary laws with regards to the Internet. It was, is, and must always remain, free.
