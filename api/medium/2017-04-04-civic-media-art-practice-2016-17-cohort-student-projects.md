The core experience and outcomes of [Civic Media, Art & Practice (CMAP)](https://elab.emerson.edu/cmap) are centered around thesis projects students produce over the course of 12-months. In certain cases, these are scaled projects in partnership with an external organization.

All CMAP projects highlight the relationship of media, art, and practice that the program strives to explore, across a wide range of approaches to the art & design of civic media: e.g., a participatory digital campaign, mobile app, public art installation, interactive curriculum, virtual platform, or game.

Below are descriptions of student projects from the CMAP 2016/17 cohort. These projects bring to life the theories and practices that each student has explored throughout their time in the program.
