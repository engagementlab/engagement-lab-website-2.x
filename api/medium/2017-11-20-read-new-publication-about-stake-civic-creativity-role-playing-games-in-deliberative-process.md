# Read new publication about @Stake: “Civic Creativity: Role-Playing Games in Deliberative Process”

![]https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_TcUiiSdnrCnplJHW.png)

**Eric Gordon**, Executive Director of the Engagement Lab and Professor at Emerson College, and **Becky Michelson**, Project Manager at the Engagement Lab, have published a new article about [@Stake](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/atstake) with **Jason Haas**, MIT Media Lab, in the [International Journal of Communication](http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/7344).

@Stake is a digital multiplayer role playing game that fosters creativity and empathy in small group deliberation that was designed and created by the Engagement Lab. Through their research, Gordon, Michelson and Haas found that @Stake enhanced what they call civic creativity — or the generation and sharing of new ideas within peer groups. They suggest that role playing games are particularly suited for this outcome within civic processes.
