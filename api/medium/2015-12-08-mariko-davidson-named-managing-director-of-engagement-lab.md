We’ve got big news to share: after more than three years as Managing Director, **Stephen Walter** will be transitioning from his role at the Engagement Lab to focus full time on building ships inside bottles and sled-dog racing. For those who may not know, Stephen has been an instrumental part of the Lab from the very beginning (back when there was still “game” in our title). Simply put, the Lab would not be the same without his tireless dedication, unique vision and sense of humor. We’re excited for his next chapter, but sad to see him go. The good news? He’s not going too far as he’ll still be involved as a member of the Lab’s advisory board.

Taking over the role of Managing Director, we’re thrilled to welcome the amazing**Mariko Davidson**. An urbanist and civic entrepreneur with an adventurous spirit, Mariko’s career spans over seven years of creative development experience with much of that time leading and designing successful domestic and international civic programs. Some of her previous achievements include launching civic programs at the [East-West Center](http://www.eastwestcenter.org/seminars-and-journalism-fellowships/policy-dialogue/asia-pacific-us-urban-dialogue) and the [Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics](http://newurbanmechanics.org/2013/09/23/east-boston-makers-movers/). She holds a Master’s in City Planning from MIT where she focused on issues of civic engagement, governance, and social equity.

Most recently, Mariko served as an Innovation Fellow where she led the open data initiative for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Needless to say, we’re excited to have her here.

When not overseeing all Lab projects, spearheading and managing Lab growth and partnerships, and taking the Lab in new and interesting directions, Mariko can be found riding her bicycle in Cambridge, or surfing the nearest coastline.

We couldn’t be happier to have Mariko joining the Engagement Lab team, and look forward to the new vision she’ll be adding as Managing Director.
