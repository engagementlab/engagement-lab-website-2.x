# It’s 2018, and the breast pump still sucks!

Mark your calendars. The Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon 2.0 is happening on **April 27–29, 2018** at the **MIT Media Lab**!

Dear parents, investors, midwives, innovators, lactation consultants, community leaders and community listeners:

A lot has happened in the space since our [2014 hackathon](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-2014-event/). We wrote [two research papers](http://www.kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CHI_Breast_Pump_Paper_2015.pdf) and talked with hundreds of experts, innovators and parents. New pumps and breastfeeding-supportive tech like [Naya](https://nayahealth.com/) and [Willow](https://www.willowpump.com/) and [Pacify](https://pacify.com/)and [UBoost](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/199848383/u-boost-first-breast-pump-booster-for-improved-lac) have emerged on the scene. But they haven’t always gotten the funding they need to continue and affordability is still a problem. We STILL don’t have paid leave in the US, and mamas and parents struggle to meet their breastfeeding goals in an unsupportive environment. Meanwhile, [black and brown babies are four times more likely to die in their first year and the rate is going up](http://www.newsweek.com/black-women-infant-mortality-rate-cdc-631178). Families in the US currently must choose between nursing their babies and paying their rent.

> > We think it’s time for Round 2 and this time we want to catalyze a movement for equitable #BreastfeedingInnovation.

We were astonished by the viral success of the [2014 hackathon](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-2014-event/), as well as its impacts. We are back with a [bigger team and an incredible Advisory Board](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/team/) to catalyze brilliance in research, design, and policy for breastfeeding. Check out our [new site](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/) to learn more about our efforts and ways to get involved. We are:

# Kickstarting new ideas at the hackathon 2.0.

We are curating teams around 3D-printed flanges, Alexa/Siri interfaces for nursing parents, smart “fourth trimester” baby scales and data visualizations of formula company money. Oh — and smarter, better, more comfortable, more affordable, more discreet, less sucky breast pumps! [_Read more here._](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/#hackathon)
