# 10 Emergency Funds & Grants for Artists and Freelancers During COVID19

In the wake of the COVID19 pandemic, we have been considering ways to support communities in need and foster connectivity in a digital world. It has been encouraging, heartwarming and inspiring for us to experience the abundance of compassion and connectivity in the artistic and freelance communities as they create emergency funds, grants, and other resources for those impacted.

While this is not a comprehensive list and there are many resources out there to support specific regions and artistic practices — as well as informational resources on transitioning online — we have chosen to highlight these ten emergency funds due to their broader nature.
