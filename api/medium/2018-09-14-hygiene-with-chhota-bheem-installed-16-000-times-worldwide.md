The curriculum includes four lessons centered on a narrative of a Clean Wizard who teaches handwashing and toilet use spells to Chhota Bheem characters, in order to defeat an evil Germ Wizard who likes to spread diseases throughout the village. Each lesson has narrated Chhota Bheem stories, physical games and activities related to the stories, and challenges children must complete to defeat the Germ Wizard. A digital game also reinforces the lessons’ learning goals.

Since its release on the Google Play Store, the Hygiene with Chhota Bheem game was viewed about 120,000 times on the Play Store and was installed nearly 16,000 times worldwide! The majority of installs (94%) occured in India, but the game has also been installed in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and the Philippines, among other places.

A pilot study in 30 primary schools in Thiruvallur district showed that children who participated in the curriculum had an increase in handwashing and toilet use knowledge, positive attitudes, and behaviors compared to children in the control group.
