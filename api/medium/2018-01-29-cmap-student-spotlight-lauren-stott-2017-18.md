**What was the path that brought you to CMAP?

**What does civic media mean to you?
**I see civic media as the variety of different communication and technology methods used to engage with public stakeholders.

**What is one change you would like to see in the world?
**I’d love to see a reversal of the widening partisanship gap, and I think civic media can help achieve that goal.

**What would you want the civic media community to know about you?
**That bureaucrats like me care about innovation and using creative ways to communicate with publics! I think government staff sometimes have a reputation for being rigid, but there is a lot of potential to incorporate new technology and media into the engagement process and I try to champion that as often as I can.

**Are there any specific projects that you’ve done in the past that intersect with your studies now?**
I worked previously as a local government intern/analyst in several Illinois communities. These roles required a lot of engagement with different stakeholders groups as we worked to incorporate visioning from these groups into strategic planning, economic development and equity initiatives.

**How do you define engagement? What does being engaged mean to you?**
Being engaged is caring enough about something to be involved in the process for making it successful.

**What are some of your favorite pieces of media?**
The New Yorker is my favorite media outlet, but I had to let my subscription lapse because it doesn’t fit into my financial and time budget right now. I’m looking forward to renewing when I graduate in August 2018!

**What’s one fun fact most people don’t know about you?**
I won the “Best Dressed Student” award for my Civic Leadership Academy in 2017.
