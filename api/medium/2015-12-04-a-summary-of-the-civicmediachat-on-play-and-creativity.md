On 4/27/15 a group of academics, students, practitioners, and curious souls discussed the meaning of creative civic engagement projects including their advantages and challenges while sharing existing examples using the hashtag #civicmediachat. The full transcript of the chat is available via this [Storify](https://storify.com/civicmediaproj/civicmediachat-the-role-of-play-and-creativity-in), with a summary of questions asked, tangents explored, and resources mentioned below.

The featured participants included authors of the [Civic Media Project](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/index) case studies [Race to the White House](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/racetothewhitehouse) and [Terra Incognita: Serendipity and Discovery in the Age of Personalization](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/terra-incognita-serendipity-and-discovery-in-the-age-of-personalization) to provide context for playful civic engagement. The arc of the chat began by broadly examining playful interactions and then more specifically questioning our relationships to algorithms, institutional barriers, and societal values of artistic civic disruptions.

> A4: If we don&#39;t make civic learning inviting &amp; fun early on, how are we to get young people to do more than &#39;rock the vote&#39;? #civicmediachat

**Conversational Tangents**

While participants mostly stayed on topic with answering the Twitter chat questions, several provocative tangents emerged. @\_PuellaLudens suggested that academia is an institutional structure which “forgot how to have fun” while @jhaas implied that building awareness without providing action cues can be debilitating:

> @civicmediaproj Sometimes I think scaled awareness w/o a pathway to scaled action is a kind of torture for the sensitive. #civicmediachat

> *Image 3: A need for growing awareness to be paired with growing resources for action, expressed by @jhaas*

When the topic of critically engaging with algorithms arose, @ninabeth shared an example of assigning her students to like everything on Facebook to illuminate the effects of our programmed social media echo chambers. Meanwhile, @pmihailidis and @wendyfhsu discussed if and how transparent algorithms could be brokered as civic data by municipal bodies. As the conversation shifted to barriers to playful civic projects, many expressed a frustration with funding opportunities, evaluation hurdles, and limiting impact assessments.

We are thrilled with the stimulating conversations, meme-ified jokes, and useful resource sharing that emerged. Thank you for your enthusiasm in promoting the chat and your patience with our first experiment with this type of convening! A special thank you to David Beasley, Communications Director of the Participatory Budgeting Project who provided extensive guidance for this event. Our next Twitter chat in early June will be, “Civic Media: Research Methods and Evaluation” and the following Twitter chat later this summer will focus on civic media curricula. Stay tuned and we hope you join us for the next chats.

Until next time:
