As digital interventions flood the civic space, investigating the mediating interfaces that provide opportunities for deeper engagement becomes necessary.

Drawing on an analysis of game mechanics, in-game actions, and interviews and focus groups with players, the authors ask if and how CPI can move citizen participation beyond isolated transactions. They draw two conclusions: CPI creates and strengthens trust among individuals and local community groups that is linked to confidence in the process of engaging, and it encourages interactive practices of engagement that the authors define as civic learning.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2015-12-03T18:27:45.043Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"5654aa55612ff206d0e7468a"},"date":{"$date":"2014-01-01T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"https://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/2195108911pb.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"566089a196ac8cc659a92e35","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b8fd0ad0a3d3edf34f079"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"}],"purchaseUrls":[],"sortOrder":8,"subCategory":{"$oid":"566075415022123b494ee5b3"},"title":" Playful Civic Learning: Enabling Lateral Trust and Reflection in Game-based Public Participation","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-29T18:18:57.044Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2a9ecc3072d2d5a0d1333"},"url":"http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2195","context":"International Journal of Communication","indexed":true}

It also points to the challenges of extending player empathy from the magic circle of gameplay to the larger context of a community meeting.

Some reports seek to counteract deterioration or disorder in urban neighborhoods (e.g., potholes), suggesting that they might be motivated by territoriality. The authors examined this question through a survey of CRM users in Boston, MA, which was combined with their patterns of reporting, as derived from the CRM database (N = 660). The survey included measures of three territorial motives and social and personal relationships with the neighborhood. They tested a three-layer model in which neighborhood relationships predict territorial motives, and both predict reporting patterns. The findings suggest that the greatest motive for such reports is to benefit the community. Other results regarding the role of social cohesion and local social networks are also discussed. Overall, the study provides a substantive interpretation for CRM reports that was previously absent.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2016-03-23T10:30:26.215Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b0c17419394b6191baa2"},"date":{"$date":"2014-08-23T04:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-expressions-of-territoriality.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-counteracting-disorder","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"}],"purchaseUrls":[],"sortOrder":23,"title":"Caring About the Community, Counteracting Disorder: 311 Reports of Public Issues as Counteracting Disorder","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-15T20:25:43.069Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b0c27419394b6191baa6"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-expressions-of-territoriality.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Journal of Environmental Psychology ","indexed":true}

In recent years, there have been a proliferation of hackathons for social impact. Skeptics point out numerous shortcomings with hackathons, including poor problem-selection, diversity and inclusion issues around who participates, the exploitation of unpaid labor, limited impact, and the dangers of positing purely technological solutions to sociotechnical issues. In this paper the authors propose that incorporating a feminist design perspective can help mitigate some of these critiques. The authors articulate one vision for what a feminist hackathon looks like by leveraging their distinct backgrounds in Critical Making, Human-Centered Design and Interventionist Art Practice in tandem with Feminist Human Computer Interaction.

This has resulted in wide and varied adoptions of media literacy in U.S. higher education which, the paper argues, has caused vague and somewhat disparate understandings of what media literacy education is and how it functions in a university classroom. The paper concludes by asking three questions about post-secondary media literacy education: Should media literacy develop definitional parameters for the university? What differentiates media literacy from other media-related disciplines? What should media literacy look like in the university? and offers suggestions for future inquiry into post-secondary media literacy education that can enable dialog around media literacy frameworks for higher education.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T16:42:05.857Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2008-11-01T04:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/are-we-speaking-the-same-language-assessing-the-state-of-media-literacy-in-us-higher-education.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"are-we-speaking-the-same-language-assessing-the-state-of-media-literacy-in-us-higher-education","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"purchaseUrls":[],"sortOrder":36,"title":"Are We Speaking the Same Language?

This article examines the range of theories of citizenship at work in citizen journalism, highlighting problems in trying to locate citizen journalism practices and practitioners within definitional debates around citizenship. It explores how some theories construct citizen journalism as a tool for citizenship whilst others construct it as constituting a form of citizenship in its own right. The article identifies a range of problems within these theories in terms of their capacity to understand the relationship between citizen journalism and citizenship.

Media literacy, as both an educational and civic movement, promotes building individual agency—the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and produce effective personal and public communication—and social agency to actively participate in civil society on local, national and global levels. Through this lens, the author argues for media literacy as a new paradigm for active engagement in daily civic life. This will provide a framework that readers can reference as they explore in subsequent chapters the global case studies that show increased civic involvement through social media platforms and mobile technologies.

Specifically, it unpacks the phenomenon of curation as a pedagogical model for enhancing civic engagement, community, and purpose within social media platforms. Online curation—an increasingly common way to refer to the act of organizing various content into cohesive online stories—has taken numerous forms in recent years. Media organizations are increasingly integrating such tools into their web presence. Curation is also being explored through remix—the sharing, repurposing, or re-appropriating of content online—as a function of creative commons and copyright, and in terms of cultural production and social structure. This chapter will build a framework for curation as it builds on existing models for digital and media education and remix culture. It will develop curation as a foundational media education competence to teach students about responsibility, purpose, and participation in social media spaces.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T18:53:28.296Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2014-01-01T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/scaffolding-curation-developing-digital-competencies-in-media-literacy-education.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"scaffolding-curation-developing-digital-competencies-in-media-literacy-education","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"purchaseUrls":[],"sortOrder":48,"title":"Scaffolding Curation: Developing Digital Competencies in Media Literacy Education","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T18:55:51.337Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/scaffolding-curation-developing-digital-competencies-in-media-literacy-education.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Media and Education in the Digital Age: Concepts, Assessments, Subversions","indexed":true}

Many of these initiatives are happening through deals brokered between vendors, developers and cities. They are made manifest in the environment as infrastructure – invisible to citizens and communities. We assert that in order to have community-centered smart cities, we need to transform sensor data collection and usage from invisible infrastructure into visible and legible interface. In this paper, we compare two different urban sensing initiatives and examine the methods used for feedback between sensors and people. We question how value gets produced and communicated to citizens in urban sensing projects and what kind of oversight and ethical considerations are necessary. Finally, we make a case for ‘seamful’ interfaces between communities, sensors and cities that reveal their inner workings for the purposes of civic pedagogy and dialogue. We conclude with five preliminary design principles for a community-centered smart city.","context":"","downloadUrls":"","purchaseUrls":"https://www.leoalmanac.org/seamful-interfaces-for-a-community-centered-smart-city-catherine-dignazio-eric-gordon-elizabeth-christoforetti/","indexed":true}

Each of the zones was governed by a local advisory group, determining what technologies were placed, what problems they could solve, and what possibilities (perhaps unanticipated) the data held for the benefit of the community. The BetaBlocks prototype made technologies visible, tangible, and actionable to people who have largely been excluded from these conversations altogether. It also provided an opportunity for technology companies to improve their products through resident input and recommendations to the City about what technologies could be most effective.
