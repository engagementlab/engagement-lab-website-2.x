His practice mixes holistic, systems-level perspectives, participatory design, and grounded ethnography to collaboratively diagnose problems and craft solutions across culture, behavior, and environment. His PhD research centered on re-designing conservation services for quinoa and crop agrobiodiversity in southern Peru. </p>\n<p>He is Host, Creative Lead and Executive Producer of the This Anthro Life Podcast, based in Boston, MA, and has over 15 years of audio production and sound engineering experience. Adam is also playing with the idea of being a Research Artist, a practitioner who infuses and transforms our experiences of academically-grounded, deep research with delight, spectacle, and  provocation. His narrative media work blends science communication, public education, curiosity and wonder with rigorous research to help expand public consciousness, empathy and collective problem solving. He believes deeply that education is a fundamental human right, and that it should be enjoyable and engaging.</p>\n<p>Selected Publications and Public Talks</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gamwell.design/#publications\">“Consulting Podcasters: Prototyping a Democratic Tool for Multiple Voices, Storytelling and Solution Finding,”</a> co-authored with Matt Artz.
