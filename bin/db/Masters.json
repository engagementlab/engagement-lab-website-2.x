This group consists of nine professors from across the college (School of Arts, School of Communication, and the Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies). Their mission is to cultivate an intellectual community at Emerson College committed to research, pedagogy and practice of civic media. Our fellowship program is at the core of this mission, bringing together faculty from the Emerson community, and beyond, to build intellectual capacity for engaged research--research with direct application to people’s lives and livelihoods.","Each summer, CMAP students interested in the education field or global development work may opt to serve as teaching assistants in the Salzburg Academy of Media and Global Change, working with undergraduates from all over the world to guide their own rapid prototyping of civic media projects. During the intensive three-week long academy, students study how culture, media, and technology can impact social movements, civic life and governance. This provides CMAP students the unique opportunity to teach others what they have learned, core to the pedagogical mission of the program. ","The Engagement Lab has been working with the Center for Civic Media at MIT, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the Tisch School for Citizenship at Tufts, to form a Civic Media Consortium. This consortium will be used to facilitate the sharing of courses, research, and graduate students across campuses. CMAP students could collaborate on research projects, take courses at other institutions, and propose their own projects for consideration.","External organizations will sign up to work with a CMAP cohort for a period of 12 months. The Engagement Lab has a strong track record of working with partner organizations, from NGOs and global advocacy organizations to cultural institutions and city governments. The Lab will cultivate partnerships to support each CMAP cohort, while partners will be encouraged to work with the Engagement Lab across cohorts on multiple facets of a single project or multiple projects."],"subheaders":["Engaged Research with Faculty Fellows from Across the College","Teaching Assistantships in the Salzburg Academy of Media and Global Change","Leverage a Network of Top Research Institutions Based in Boston","Partnerships with External Organizations"],"headers":["Engaged Research","International Scope                        ","Academic Collaborations","Real-World Collaborations"],"name":"Graduate Program Page","createdAt":{"$date":"2016-01-29T20:57:06.822Z"},"__v":11,"apply":{"html":"<p>CMAP strives to produce leaders of the knowledge economy and aims to help empower young entrepreneurs, socially-engaged artists, and civic leaders who will embrace innovative and dynamic career opportunities.
