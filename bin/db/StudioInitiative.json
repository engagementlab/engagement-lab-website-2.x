Brown Peace Institute. This Boston-based collaboration is exploring narrative interventions to interrupt the crisis of gun violence through partnered studios in media, arts and communication. Multi-disciplinary studio classes at Emerson College work alongside community partners to understand the roots and impacts of gun violence narratives in media and co-create interventions. Through a collaborative design approach, this initiative centers those most impacted by the effects of gun violence, in the exploration and creation of narrative interventions to restore urgency, dignity, and humanity to this pervasive issue.","sortOrder":1,"key":"transforming-narratives-of-gun-violence","__v":7,"featuredProjectBlurb":"","thumb":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/studios/vksf94ganaumtkmdtn84","version":1643664638,"signature":"c471e54279c885bea4cd87eaaec25f4af6b18511","width":600,"height":450,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1643664638/homepage-2.0/studios/vksf94ganaumtkmdtn84.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1643664638/homepage-2.0/studios/vksf94ganaumtkmdtn84.jpg"},"galleryVideoCaptions":["Watch our launch event!","About the initiative."],"galleryVideoThumbails":[{"_id":{"$oid":"61f2d3cc9e10a8319170ca82"},"public_id":"homepage-2.0/studios/nsycltuy8ynnkcnqzex9","version":1643303883,"signature":"5d2d04cd456a80189f3e9fbb2b8b98e102e860b5","format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1643303883/homepage-2.0/studios/nsycltuy8ynnkcnqzex9.jpg","width":1024,"height":597,"secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1643303883/homepage-2.0/studios/nsycltuy8ynnkcnqzex9.jpg"},{"_id":{"$oid":"6303ca0ae9debb52ecfcfcae"},"public_id":"homepage-2.0/studios/vjjfiicckde8khvf42u1","version":1661192714,"signature":"5c62727f2e8315f1f771d8d8812a34c51bbc1312","width":1920,"height":1080,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1661192714/homepage-2.0/studios/vjjfiicckde8khvf42u1.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1661192714/homepage-2.0/studios/vjjfiicckde8khvf42u1.png"}],"galleryVideoTitles":["Launch Event","Intro Video"],"galleryVideos":["700855165","654694654"],"problemSpace":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
