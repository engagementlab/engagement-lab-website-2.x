The conversation starts with money. Collaborations with institutions and expectations are guided by finances. For example, grant funding with universities often offer more flexibility. Foundation funding grants often function at the beginning of a long-range process to set the agenda over several years. When money comes from a fee-for-service model, in conjunction with multiple municipalities, MAPC has to negotiate among differences in financial capacity, in order to maximize voices in the collaborative process. One of the challenges is how to work with smaller municipalities when their funding models are at a much smaller scale.<em>“Best practices” are defined only in relation to large municipalities adopting an intervention.</em> Financial planning cycles often differ between institutions — fiscal year, academic calendar, grant-making timeline.</p>\n<h1 id=\"kei-kawashima-ginsberg-from-circle\"><a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/kei-kawashima-ginsberg-named-new-director-of-circle/\">**Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg</a> from Circle**</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_SLI9xgz-ZzlOtOSW.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When institutions in the community want to partner with academic institutions, certain challenges arise, particularly in the arena of culture. <a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/\">Circle</a>‘s research is informed mainly by practice, separate from institutions.

Another challenge is working with faculty who plan courses maybe 6-months out, but grants often require a planning timeline up to a year out. There can be ways around this, if institutions are willing to be flexible, working on shorter funding timelines. Another challenge and opportunity involves the sustainability of research projects in communities, how they can go on after the initial research and injection of funding ends.

This repetition of use of a platform was rare and beneficial, to get to know the researcher and his methodology, e.g., <a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/about/#people\">Eric Gordon</a>‘s emphasis on the role of empathy in his research interests. Cut down on the time to figure out how to work together. <a href=\"http://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/joseph-ferreira\">Joe Fereirra</a> at <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/\">MIT</a>, <a href=\"http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html\">Metric Future Project</a>. — two way learning relationship, understand each other’s cycles, how students can get involved. From the MAPC perspective, it’s important to make sure academics remember to include communities, think of processes as community-driven.</p>\n<p>Eric Gordon: Academic outcomes from the universities’ perspective was productive in terms of understanding limitations. This work also helped Emerson College grow as an institution, as Eric moved ahead with his research interests. Structures now in place at Emerson were born out of the initial work Engagement Lab did with MAPC.</p>\n<p>CM: Important to note from these examples how various parties “learn to speak each other’s languages” in a long-term, evolved relationship: adjusting to each other’s need, being flexible.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Q1: There are three different kinds of projects: pedagogy (classroom), internships (connecting with the profession world, and “basic“ research (intersection between academics and the agencies working in the community is the place where most things go awry). How can we maximize that third category?</p>\n<p>KKG: Communicating clearly about outcomes and commitments throughout and after the research is done.</p>\n<p>CM: When there is a higher degree of trust between the researcher and the partnering agency or community, there are often better outcomes. When agencies or companies cannot share proprietary data, company/agency can be flexible by taking on a graduate student as an intern and have them work internally.</p>\n<p>HS: Sharing data openly is not a problem for MAPC, but things get tricky when the faculty and students want to engage directly with the community. Trust is at stake and MAPC is on the line with the community, when professors or students don’t come through.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Q2: For basic research, we are not necessarily trained to think in terms of reciprocity. Have you seen places where the sense of reciprocity clicked? How can we better cultivate this?</p>\n<p>KKG: When Circle worked with <a href=\"http://www.indianahumanities.org/\">Indiana Humanities</a> they wanted to map what the civic network looked like in Indiana and what key relationships were in place. From the IH side, it was critical to have researchers to take the information garnered from the relationships and then help them understand what directions they should be moving over the next several years. That is an example of an easy, great collaboration, because everyone came to the table with openness and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>HS: From the outset of any project, its important to have an honest conversation of what skills will need to be in place to build the capacity of communities, with all the stakeholders around the table in the collaborative process. Having a mindful conversation about that in the beginning of a project or relationship is so important.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Q3: The need for connectors between entities in the community and academic researchers. As we talk about civic media, how do we ensure that we are not excluding those institutions that are most in need with the least resources, so that they can benefit most from what academia can offer?</p>\n<p>CM: It’s all about putting good people together — it’s not about institutions. When companies want to work with an institution, it’s important to ask “who? which faculty member, which graduate student?” because they are the ones who will be making things happen and doing the work. How do we retain the humanness, but expand the network to maximize the availability of opportunities? Institutions with high profiles get tapped often, but also can reach capacity faster because of that. There is a value judgement and strategic aspect to deciding where and with whom to work.</p>\n<p>KKG: Important to spread the word in the community that Circle was available to do work in partnership with communities. Otherwise, the partnerships were not eventually distributed across different demographics.</p>\n<p>HS: It’s important not to tap the same neighborhoods over and over and to expand the way we think about “needy” neighborhoods. For example, in Boston, Dudley often gets tapped, but there are many other neighborhoods that are in need of these kinds of relationships with academic institutions.</p>\n<p>Paul concludes by saying there is space for better understanding the role of universities in connecting with surrounding communities, tying academic research to needs in the lived world of communities.</p>\n","md":"\n### By Engagement Lab\n\n06/11/2015\n\n_This is a liveblog account created by Christina Wilson, Becky Michelson, Alex Eby and Jedd Cohen at the [Boston Civic Media Metrics &amp; Methods Conference.](https://bostoncivic.media/) (Cross posted at [the MIT Center for Civic Media](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/mayawagon/institutions-panel))_\n\nThis panel will engage in a discussion on the role of institutions–universities, governments, public and private organizations–in civic media research and practice.

[Joe Fereirra](http://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/joseph-ferreira) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), [Metric Future Project](http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html). — two way learning relationship, understand each other’s cycles, how students can get involved. From the MAPC perspective, it’s important to make sure academics remember to include communities, think of processes as community-driven.\n\nEric Gordon: Academic outcomes from the universities’ perspective was productive in terms of understanding limitations. This work also helped Emerson College grow as an institution, as Eric moved ahead with his research interests. Structures now in place at Emerson were born out of the initial work Engagement Lab did with MAPC.\n\nCM: Important to note from these examples how various parties “learn to speak each other’s languages” in a long-term, evolved relationship: adjusting to each other’s need, being flexible.\n\n&gt; &gt; Q1: There are three different kinds of projects: pedagogy (classroom), internships (connecting with the profession world, and “basic“ research (intersection between academics and the agencies working in the community is the place where most things go awry). How can we maximize that third category?\n\nKKG: Communicating clearly about outcomes and commitments throughout and after the research is done.\n\nCM: When there is a higher degree of trust between the researcher and the partnering agency or community, there are often better outcomes. When agencies or companies cannot share proprietary data, company/agency can be flexible by taking on a graduate student as an intern and have them work internally.\n\nHS: Sharing data openly is not a problem for MAPC, but things get tricky when the faculty and students want to engage directly with the community. Trust is at stake and MAPC is on the line with the community, when professors or students don’t come through.\n\n&gt; &gt; Q2: For basic research, we are not necessarily trained to think in terms of reciprocity. Have you seen places where the sense of reciprocity clicked? How can we better cultivate this?\n\nKKG: When Circle worked with [Indiana Humanities](http://www.indianahumanities.org/) they wanted to map what the civic network looked like in Indiana and what key relationships were in place. From the IH side, it was critical to have researchers to take the information garnered from the relationships and then help them understand what directions they should be moving over the next several years. That is an example of an easy, great collaboration, because everyone came to the table with openness and enthusiasm.\n\nHS: From the outset of any project, its important to have an honest conversation of what skills will need to be in place to build the capacity of communities, with all the stakeholders around the table in the collaborative process. Having a mindful conversation about that in the beginning of a project or relationship is so important.\n\n&gt; &gt; Q3: The need for connectors between entities in the community and academic researchers. As we talk about civic media, how do we ensure that we are not excluding those institutions that are most in need with the least resources, so that they can benefit most from what academia can offer?\n\nCM: It’s all about putting good people together — it’s not about institutions. When companies want to work with an institution, it’s important to ask “who? which faculty member, which graduate student?” because they are the ones who will be making things happen and doing the work. How do we retain the humanness, but expand the network to maximize the availability of opportunities? Institutions with high profiles get tapped often, but also can reach capacity faster because of that. There is a value judgement and strategic aspect to deciding where and with whom to work.\n\nKKG: Important to spread the word in the community that Circle was available to do work in partnership with communities. Otherwise, the partnerships were not eventually distributed across different demographics.\n\nHS: It’s important not to tap the same neighborhoods over and over and to expand the way we think about “needy” neighborhoods. For example, in Boston, Dudley often gets tapped, but there are many other neighborhoods that are in need of these kinds of relationships with academic institutions.\n\nPaul concludes by saying there is space for better understanding the role of universities in connecting with surrounding communities, tying academic research to needs in the lived world of communities.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2015-12-04T05:00:00Z"},"key":"boston-civic-media-metrics-and-methods-conference-or-session-3-institutions","__v":0}

Our work at CUP focuses on the barriers there are to understanding public policy and planning issues and decision-making processes that really shape the place that we all live. We collaborate with community orgs and advocacy groups that come to us with specific issues that people are trying to engage around and are having trouble with and we work with them and with designers to come up with accessible visual things.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I always ask why people ask me to be part of civic media things because our chosen medium is often print.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Questions we keep asking ourselves over and over: “What tools can we create to foster real meaningful community engagement? and What does that look like? We really think of our projects as tools. How do people really process information? How do people actually process information? How do people learn and engage with things? We try to use a lot of the research out there for how people actually process visual information and how we incorporate that into our work. We want to know how embodied information works, how people physically interact with objects, and how that deepens their learning and their memory of information, so we try to incorporate things like that.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We also think a lot about how do we meet people where they’re at. Sometimes literally (i.e. in the subway) but also languages, levels of literacy, what kinds of cultural references our work carries. That’s really critical for us. We try to collaborate directly with the communities we’re trying to reach to make sure they have input on that. It’s a real challenge, especially in the civic media space, as someone observed at our table, in a room that’s 95% white, what cultural references we’re bringing into our work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It’s important to know what obstacles people are actually facing, and to know what fears people have. We work a lot in immigrant communities. The first part of the project is usually addressing what the policy is not, because of the fears people have that are preventing them from hearing the real information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How do you use the power of narrative and personal experience to build bridges between poorly served communities and things like government services and decision making processes, especially when there are moments when people who are not part of decision making processes are not getting services, and sometimes it’s intentional. People are sometimes being intentionally excluded from those things, so how do you work in that space where that kind of tension exists?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In this project, we had to teach people how to work with NYCHA, but since historically NYCHA has not always been useful for them, we have to give them alternative methods to get around working with NYCHA.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can we guarantee we’re not wasting people’s time? In particular, we don’t want to have people be worse off for engaging. We don’t want people coming out feeling more frustrated, or disempowered, or cynical, which is a real danger because then you’ve lost people.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When do you work directly with individuals, and when do you work with intermediaries? In a lot of situations you can actually have more impact working with intermediaries.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a lot of civic tech space, there’s a pathological view of government as something that’s seen as broken. Like, tech is going to bring efficiency to these processes. But it’s about engagement, not efficiency. It’s about democracy, which frankly can be super inefficient, especially when it’s being inclusive. We’re never going to solve for inclusiveness and engagement if we’re always focused on solving for efficiency.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_10SyR5Kbb0kBec_s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan Zuckerman</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What does it mean to be an effective civic actor? What does it mean to help people become effective civic actors?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We get these stories every two years about how bad we are at turning out to vote and what bad civic actors we are, but I see something very different on the ground, I see people turning out for a wide variety of civic activities, and protests, and engaging in many different ways. Part of what I’ve been trying to figure out is why we have this narrative that essentially beats people up for being so bad at civics.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Maybe there’s a reason people aren’t voting. There’s very very little confidence in government. Confidence in all branches of government is on a steady slide. If you go deeper than this Gallup data, we have distrust in institutions of all kinds. You find this decline in trust of universities, in nonprofits, in all kinds of institutions. The only institutions in which we appear to have increasing confidence are the military and the police, which is more than a little terrifying. This sounds a little more like Egypt.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How do we deal with this question of effective civics at a moment when we have very very low confidence in institutions? I think there are really good reasons to have low confidence in institutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This leaves us with an uncomfortable divide: Christopher calls this the Institutionalist versus the Insurrectionist divide. He suggests that this is perhaps a better way of understanding politics in this country right now than the division between left and right. It’s a division of people who think we can make change within the institutions we have and people who think we either need to overthrow or radically transform those institutions to have a hope for change. I want to suggest that in rooms like this there tends to be a very very strong institutionalist bias. A lot of what we tend to do in this field of civics is say “if we understood these institutions better, if we understood how we interfaced with them and understood how we could have power within these institutions, we would find a way to have change. I do not necessarily disagree with this, but I know there are a whole lot of people who aren’t buying it. I want to make sure there is a path for civic change for people who find themselves on the insurrectionist side. (Christopher hayes: twilight of the elite)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In our lab we use the technique called the “Inverted Lessig”. Lessig says we think of laws as the main way we regulate society, but there’s actually a bunch of ways we regulate society. Code makes certain behaviors possible or impossible, markets make certain things expensive or cheap, norms make certain behaviors acceptable or unacceptable. In the Inverted Lessig, we say these are all ways to be effective civic actors. When you spend time in the insurrectionist space, you spend a lot of time in the non-law side of this space.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We think a lot also about thick vs. thin. We talk about this critique of “clicktivism.” [People often ask,] does any of this stuff really matter? Are you just clicking buttons and not taking action out in the world? Where is it appropriate to ask for one or the other (thick or thin engagement)? If you’re giving your whole self to vote, that’s voter suppression. We want voting to be a thin interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What does effective civics look like at a moment of high institutional mistrust?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_UlhMRQx3NzP4YXwg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Peter Levine</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I will make a quick institutionalist case with two slides.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>My question is, how can we achieve really broad based civic engagement at a time when choice is massively disaggregated?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We need to recruit people for non-civic reasons at scale with a business model or some other way of operating at scale that can bring a lot of people in whether they want to be civic or not, and that can bring people into civic life. If we don’t have lots of little NGOs and tools, we’re going to continue to see a pattern where only the most advanced or interested are participating.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_70qH1zETJlsX3f3b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Doris Sommer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I also want to talk about distrust of institutions by talking about my favorite mayor, a mayor of Bogotà.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“They elected a nerd out of despair”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He said, “let’s go after traffic death because we can’t go after drug lords just yet. We have to show change is possible,” because no one thought change was possible, so his secretary of culture said “nothing to do boss, it’s time to bring out the clowns” so he fired 20 corrupt traffic police and put 20 pantomime artists out with no authority. This was the first icebreaker. What I want to say is that without art, and participatory art, there was no way to crack the ice in Bogotà.

There is nothing wrong with us as a people.</li>\n</ul>\n","md":"\n### By Engagement Lab\n\n06/11/2015\n\n**\\*This is a liveblog account contributed to by Maya Wagoner at the** [Boston Civic Media Metrics &amp; Methods Conference.](https://bostoncivic.media/)\\*\n\n&gt; &gt; What are the unanswered questions that drive your work?\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_LLIrszGAVGZckDTn.jpg)\n\n**Christine Gaspar**\n\n-   As all of you know there are lots of barriers to participate in civic life. Our work at CUP focuses on the barriers there are to understanding public policy and planning issues and decision-making processes that really shape the place that we all live. We collaborate with community orgs and advocacy groups that come to us with specific issues that people are trying to engage around and are having trouble with and we work with them and with designers to come up with accessible visual things.\n\n-   I always ask why people ask me to be part of civic media things because our chosen medium is often print.\n\n-   Questions we keep asking ourselves over and over: “What tools can we create to foster real meaningful community engagement? and What does that look like? We really think of our projects as tools. How do people really process information? How do people actually process information? How do people learn and engage with things? We try to use a lot of the research out there for how people actually process visual information and how we incorporate that into our work. We want to know how embodied information works, how people physically interact with objects, and how that deepens their learning and their memory of information, so we try to incorporate things like that.\n\n-   We also think a lot about how do we meet people where they’re at. Sometimes literally (i.e. in the subway) but also languages, levels of literacy, what kinds of cultural references our work carries. That’s really critical for us. We try to collaborate directly with the communities we’re trying to reach to make sure they have input on that. It’s a real challenge, especially in the civic media space, as someone observed at our table, in a room that’s 95% white, what cultural references we’re bringing into our work.\n\n-   It’s important to know what obstacles people are actually facing, and to know what fears people have. We work a lot in immigrant communities. The first part of the project is usually addressing what the policy is not, because of the fears people have that are preventing them from hearing the real information.\n\n-   How do you use the power of narrative and personal experience to build bridges between poorly served communities and things like government services and decision making processes, especially when there are moments when people who are not part of decision making processes are not getting services, and sometimes it’s intentional. People are sometimes being intentionally excluded from those things, so how do you work in that space where that kind of tension exists?\n\n-   In this project, we had to teach people how to work with NYCHA, but since historically NYCHA has not always been useful for them, we have to give them alternative methods to get around working with NYCHA.\n\n-   How can we guarantee we’re not wasting people’s time? In particular, we don’t want to have people be worse off for engaging. We don’t want people coming out feeling more frustrated, or disempowered, or cynical, which is a real danger because then you’ve lost people.\n\n-   When do you work directly with individuals, and when do you work with intermediaries? In a lot of situations you can actually have more impact working with intermediaries.\n\n-   In a lot of civic tech space, there’s a pathological view of government as something that’s seen as broken. Like, tech is going to bring efficiency to these processes. But it’s about engagement, not efficiency. It’s about democracy, which frankly can be super inefficient, especially when it’s being inclusive. We’re never going to solve for inclusiveness and engagement if we’re always focused on solving for efficiency.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_10SyR5Kbb0kBec_s.jpg)\n\n**Ethan Zuckerman**\n\n-   What does it mean to be an effective civic actor? What does it mean to help people become effective civic actors?\n\n-   We get these stories every two years about how bad we are at turning out to vote and what bad civic actors we are, but I see something very different on the ground, I see people turning out for a wide variety of civic activities, and protests, and engaging in many different ways. Part of what I’ve been trying to figure out is why we have this narrative that essentially beats people up for being so bad at civics.\n\n-   Maybe there’s a reason people aren’t voting. There’s very very little confidence in government. Confidence in all branches of government is on a steady slide. If you go deeper than this Gallup data, we have distrust in institutions of all kinds. You find this decline in trust of universities, in nonprofits, in all kinds of institutions. The only institutions in which we appear to have increasing confidence are the military and the police, which is more than a little terrifying. This sounds a little more like Egypt.\n\n-   How do we deal with this question of effective civics at a moment when we have very very low confidence in institutions? I think there are really good reasons to have low confidence in institutions.\n\n-   This leaves us with an uncomfortable divide: Christopher calls this the Institutionalist versus the Insurrectionist divide. He suggests that this is perhaps a better way of understanding politics in this country right now than the division between left and right. It’s a division of people who think we can make change within the institutions we have and people who think we either need to overthrow or radically transform those institutions to have a hope for change. I want to suggest that in rooms like this there tends to be a very very strong institutionalist bias. A lot of what we tend to do in this field of civics is say “if we understood these institutions better, if we understood how we interfaced with them and understood how we could have power within these institutions, we would find a way to have change. I do not necessarily disagree with this, but I know there are a whole lot of people who aren’t buying it. I want to make sure there is a path for civic change for people who find themselves on the insurrectionist side. (Christopher hayes: twilight of the elite)\n\n-   In our lab we use the technique called the “Inverted Lessig”. Lessig says we think of laws as the main way we regulate society, but there’s actually a bunch of ways we regulate society. Code makes certain behaviors possible or impossible, markets make certain things expensive or cheap, norms make certain behaviors acceptable or unacceptable. In the Inverted Lessig, we say these are all ways to be effective civic actors. When you spend time in the insurrectionist space, you spend a lot of time in the non-law side of this space.\n\n-   We think a lot also about thick vs. thin. We talk about this critique of “clicktivism.” [People often ask,] does any of this stuff really matter? Are you just clicking buttons and not taking action out in the world? Where is it appropriate to ask for one or the other (thick or thin engagement)? If you’re giving your whole self to vote, that’s voter suppression. We want voting to be a thin interaction.\n\n-   What does effective civics look like at a moment of high institutional mistrust?\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_UlhMRQx3NzP4YXwg.jpg)\n\n**Peter Levine**\n\n-   I will make a quick institutionalist case with two slides.\n\n-   My question is, how can we achieve really broad based civic engagement at a time when choice is massively disaggregated?\n\n-   We need to recruit people for non-civic reasons at scale with a business model or some other way of operating at scale that can bring a lot of people in whether they want to be civic or not, and that can bring people into civic life. If we don’t have lots of little NGOs and tools, we’re going to continue to see a pattern where only the most advanced or interested are participating.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_70qH1zETJlsX3f3b.jpg)\n\n**Doris Sommer**\n\n-   I also want to talk about distrust of institutions by talking about my favorite mayor, a mayor of Bogotà.\n\n-   “They elected a nerd out of despair”\n\n-   He said, “let’s go after traffic death because we can’t go after drug lords just yet. We have to show change is possible,” because no one thought change was possible, so his secretary of culture said “nothing to do boss, it’s time to bring out the clowns” so he fired 20 corrupt traffic police and put 20 pantomime artists out with no authority. This was the first icebreaker. What I want to say is that without art, and participatory art, there was no way to crack the ice in Bogotà. The definition of art is simply, making something that didn’t exist before. That’s why technology and art are so close, that’s why art and design are close on rosters. art is simply artifice. If we’re not artists, we can’t make change. That’s the bottom line for reintegrating arts and humanities in this important project of civic engagement. How do you think about change if you don’t think like an artist?\n\n-   How do you make good news popular? How do you make it sell in the media? I ask my journalist friends, “how come we don’t know about good news?”\n\n-   What Mockus did was a statistical analysis of the where traffic deaths were most likely to occur, and he tried a couple of different methods of interventions. Try again, fail again, fail better. That’s a quote from Beckett. One artist said “let’s make public graves where traffic deaths happened”\n\n-   The artist Pedro Reyes melted guns and made shovels and instruments.\n\n-   Why doesn’t good news travel? How can we use civic media to make good news travel so we have good practices not to copy but to inspire us? How do we get out of academic silos when we talk about sparking interactions? I work in Latin American literature. I want to be working more closely with colleagues in politics, with colleagues at the Ed school, with colleagues in sociology, with colleagues who know how to do evaluations so we know what we’re doing.

Before he joined Tableau in 2012, he was a professor of computer science at UNC Charlotte. Robert has created visualization techniques like Parallel Sets and performed research into the perceptual and cognitive basics of visualization. Recently, his research has focused on how to communicate data using tools from visualization, and how storytelling can be adapted to incorporate data, interaction, and visualization.*</p>\n<p><em>This is a liveblog account by Catherine D’Ignazio.</em></p>\n<p>He leads the group through an exercise of raising hands if categories apply to you — Have you seen a movie? Read a book? People raise their hands.</p>\n<p>Stories are all around us. We are used to them. We understand them. They work for us. He is going to talk about why that is and how we can build stories with data.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Stories?</strong></p>\n<p>He will tell a story to answer this question. It’s about a young woman who walks into a bar in Berlin in the 1920’s. She is doing her grad studies in a new field called psychology. He shows a slide of a cat. You all are now paying attention.</p>\n<p>We tell stories because they get our attention. We also tell them because they are memorable. This is like “stickiness”. This is part of the process of communication of data — what do you want people to do with your data? If you just throw bar charts at people they won’t remember them.</p>\n<p>But the way memory works is not like a computer. We don’t just store info in our brains. Little bubbles float around in our head and you try — like with velcro — to hook those memories. The way memory works — you have to remember something to remember something else. They give you connective tissue between items of information. Stories have used for many years to convey information to the next generation.

Robert has created visualization techniques like Parallel Sets and performed research into the perceptual and cognitive basics of visualization. Recently, his research has focused on how to communicate data using tools from visualization, and how storytelling can be adapted to incorporate data, interaction, and visualization.\\*\n\n_This is a liveblog account by Catherine D’Ignazio._\n\nHe leads the group through an exercise of raising hands if categories apply to you — Have you seen a movie? Read a book? People raise their hands.\n\nStories are all around us. We are used to them. We understand them. They work for us. He is going to talk about why that is and how we can build stories with data.\n\n**Why Stories?**\n\nHe will tell a story to answer this question. It’s about a young woman who walks into a bar in Berlin in the 1920’s. She is doing her grad studies in a new field called psychology. He shows a slide of a cat. You all are now paying attention.\n\nWe tell stories because they get our attention. We also tell them because they are memorable. This is like “stickiness”. This is part of the process of communication of data — what do you want people to do with your data? If you just throw bar charts at people they won’t remember them.\n\nBut the way memory works is not like a computer. We don’t just store info in our brains. Little bubbles float around in our head and you try — like with velcro — to hook those memories. The way memory works — you have to remember something to remember something else. They give you connective tissue between items of information. Stories have used for many years to convey information to the next generation. There are some arguments that say that stories predate complex language.\n\n**How to tell Stories with Data?**\n\nThere are two parts to this. One is techniques and one is structure. There are visualization techniques specific to storytelling — “presentation-only techniques”.

Boston’s vibrant tech sector, civic environment, scholarly community, and array of community organizers make this a valuable opportunity to bring together various fields, traditions and methods of inquiry about the design of materials for inquiry and collective civic benefit. Each of these groups has different methods for describing and understanding the world, and different audiences that they address. The tension in this panel is to showcase the variety of civic methods among the panelist: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_art\">participatory art</a> , <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography\">ethnography</a> , <a href=\"http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/qualdata.php\">qualitative data</a> , and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science\">citizen science</a>. How can we start to coordinate our various efforts in a deliberate and intentional ways to make our cities better: from implementation, to evaluation, to reporting to the public? This conference is the kick-off to the Boston Civic Media Consortium that will begin to give us the chance in Boston to keep exploring these questions over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Given the proliferation of methods, <strong>1) what should our goals for civic engagement be?</strong> (Catherine’s emphasis is on the biggest tent possible. But then, is that too fuzzy?) And then, <strong>2) who is our research for?</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"catherine-dignazio\">Catherine D’Ignazio</h1>\n<p><strong>Participatory Art + Civic Goals —</strong> Art can be a research method for activating civic imagination and mentions examples like <a href=\"http://visitsteve.com/\">Steve Lambert’s</a> work. To explore this, Catherine introduces the <a href=\"http://www.ikatun.org/institute/infinitelysmallthings/\">Institute for Infinitely Small Things</a>(IIST), and a project they did in Cambridge to explore overlooked or ignored aspects of everyday life. <a href=\"http://www.ikatun.org/kanarinka/the-city-formerly-known-as-cambridge/\">“The City Formerly Known as Cambridge”</a> was a particular project, looking at the names of public places in Cambridge and the dominance of Anglo-Saxon names commemorated on public squares, streets and monuments around Harvard Square. (<a href=\"http://www.maps-inc.org/\">Portuguese Alliance</a> lobbied for a very long time to get <a href=\"http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=400+Cardinal+Medeiros+Ave&amp;city=Cambridge&amp;state=MA&amp;zipcode=02141&amp;redirect=true\">Cardinal Medeiros Street</a> named — then misspelled when the sign was put up!) What would the city look like if the present-day community could rename the city with names that mattered to them? IIST hosted “Renaming Parties” in partnership with co-current events around Cambridge to engage the public in conversation about why things were named as they were, and then to submit a new name. Much of the project was about the very construction of the artifice in public to have these conversations. Each person gave their input, story, and address to connect after the new map was created. At the end of two years, an artifact was produced, “A Map of the City Formerly Known as Cambridge.“ Some renamed locations quite personally — for their dog, a family member — but others submitted named related to how spaces are currently used, perhaps to claim space, e.g., Cambridge Common (Freaks), a school that used a grassy common for grazing cows, and then some referenced historical events / business. Some organized groups were in the process of officially changing the name of certain streets, as well. Everyone who submitted a card, submitted a story, and each of these were recorded as references points on the map. <strong>This is just one example of how art can be used to activate civic imagination.</strong> Even though these names did not officially change, it nevertheless allowed participants to** feel a sense of empowerment in collective visioning.**</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_uTaJaBQL4CIelPC0.jpg\" alt=\"A Map of the City Formerly Known as Cambridge by The Institute for Infinitely Small Things\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"kate-krontiris\">Kate Krontiris</h1>\n<p>Kate identifies herself outside of formal academia, in the intersection of researcher, strategist, and facilitator, exemplified in the work she has done as an applied researcher with a background in public policy and business. Her most recent project, carried out with Google’s Civic Innovation team, is interested in looking at the people in the middle — <a href=\"http://katekrontiris.com/\">“interested by-standers”</a> — who are interested in civic life, but not taking action. Her team looked at six cities across the US (San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, Phoenix, Chicago, Boston), conducting in depth interviews paired with conjoint quantitative surveys done in those locations. Findings at: <a href=\"http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/\">googlepolitics.blogspot.com</a>. Interesting paradoxes were uncovered about the way this group views their power and engagement choices in civic life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OYcVPH7PF3G6kh0-.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When thinking about how to share the findings from the research: 1) inform products and services at Google related to civic life and 2) share with the broader civic tech eco-system to inform their work to activate this interested bystander segment of the population. <strong>The data is meant to help others working in this field better understand the needs and perceptions of the people who would be using the civic tech tools they create.</strong> There is a rigorous internal review process at Google when communicating research publicly, different from the academic review process and reliant on feed-back from the broader community. The work was submitted to <a href=\"http://epicpeople.org/2015/\">EPIC Conference</a> for presentation and feedback. The feedback they got was jarring, stating that the research was interesting, but not enough informed by a theoretical framework. This critique initially came as a blow to to the Kate and her research team at Google, but then forced them to ask what their original goals were: making a contribution to the applied work going on at this moment in time, not reshaping the theoretical conversation among academics.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed methods approach</strong> — qualitative and quantitative — the quantitive data from surveys surveys were used to validate signals picked up in the in-depth conversations (qualitative data) and note points of divergence. Currently, she is trying to think of ways to circle back to the qualitative side to bring stories to bear on some of the quantitative findings. Anyone interested in pursuing this kind of work should reach out to Kate.</p>\n<h1 id=\"sarah-williams\"><a href=\"https://bostoncivicmedia.hackpad.com/ep/profile/xiCGvKFdyrG\">Sarah Williams</a></h1>\n<p>As the director of the <a href=\"http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/\">Civic Data Design Lab</a> Sarah’s work is informed by the question: How can we use data to effect civic policy change? She tells the story of the garment district and rezoning for current use needs. CDDL used data from<a href=\"http://www.checkinfashion.com/\">tracking fashion workers</a> to show where they were moving in the district and the areas they were most using, in order to shape the rezoning guidelines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digitalmatatus.com/\">Another case in Nairobi</a> looked at the data on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fybwZ971Sv8\">matatus</a> (small minibus taxis), main public transport in the city, low cost (.30 USD/ride), set by drivers. City Council data set was incomplete about where these matatus moved. CDDL leveraged the wide-spread use of cell phones to build out the dataset, using the public (GTFS). There was a concerted engagement process throughout the data collection process with the local technology community, government, academia, the Matatu Owners Association, drivers and NGOs — giving them all a sense of co-ownership in the data, so that it would be used by them. In addition to digital tools, CDDL developed a paper map that everyday citizens could use. They held a hackathon, out of which emerged the app, FlashCast Sonar, and MA3Routewhich relays traffic accidents to help drivers. Subsequently, there was a movement to have these maps adopted as the official maps of the city, working with local government leaders. <strong>When others leverage data created to effect their own policy change, this is what CDDL considers success</strong>. Other cities have adopted the method and to use in other cities, and other apps that use the data related to city planning, local citizens use the data and UN Habitat have been using the data and graphics in their work. Success is when people take on the data of applied research projects and continue to use in in new interventions and products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_LxayiQ6jLr0mSrcA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"matthew-battles-and-cris-magliozzi-from-metalab\"><a href=\"http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/\">Matthew Battles</a> and Cris Magliozzi <a href=\"http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/\">from MetaLab</a></h1>\n<p>What kinds of engagement might be possible, Matthew asks. What are the kinds of methods that drive research interests in the humanities: <strong>exploring and making accessible collections / archives; impact of technologies on these collections; looking historically at these collections at libraries.</strong> <a href=\"http://metalab.harvard.edu/2015/02/cold-storage-premiere-today/\">Cold Storage</a> project has made media <a href=\"http://librarybeyondthebook.org/cold_storage/\">(short films</a>, interactive website) and technologies to <strong>uncover the invisible infrastructure</strong> at the Harvard Library, the depository system which handles 10 million volumes off-campus, not open to the public. HarvardDirect is the digital tool meant to eventually erase the physical repository space. The depository location in the real world is 30 miles away from campus. First step was to explore the physical space of the depository with architects and designers, and the specific role of this place: temperature controlled designed to preserve books for 500 years. Film documents the activities of the librarians at the depository who do not directly participate in life at Harvard in Cambridge. The* Cold Storage* film was a kind of ethnography designed to bring to light these stories. Subsequently, students in the design seminar have engaged with the Cold Storage research to embark on their own projects with the Harvard depository and its staff — E.g.,<a href=\"http://librarybeyondthebook.org/\">librarybeyondthebook.org</a> /coldstorage</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_19P6Cmy_iS7KxSdv.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"dietmar-offenhuber\"><a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/\">Dietmar Offenhuber</a></h1>\n<p><strong>Beyond Truth and Bias: a design-oriented approach to data quantification.</strong>We often take the concept of bias for granted, but Dietmar argues that this is an assumption in the process of knowledge-making that merits exploration. If we only look at data generated by volunteers in terms of “accuracy” instead of in relation to truth and bias, then we might be missing important parts of the story — for example, the impact of the digital divide on the data, which then gets compounded by reporting and representation. The very concept of bias implies access to objective truth. Categories of “truth” / “accuracy” do not always apply to civic media. What do we mean by bias: 1) implicit assumptions — rhetoric about the inherent value of public participation. How does design mediate the conflicts that emerge in the tension between bias and stories told through data? <strong>Implicit assumptions shape design, and design shapes the conversation.</strong> Deitmar is particularly interested in how qualitative information is key to understanding quantitative data — e.g., GPS data is high quantitative, but the notion of “place” is very much qualitatively constructed. In another of his projects, unearthing tone, rhetoric, rationale in the stories surrounding quantitative data points — -e.g., the stories told in See Click Fix reporting — gives new insight into the politics of participation. <a href=\"http://offenhuber.net/urban-entropy/\">Urban Entropy (2015)</a> installation at Ars Electronica in Austria: if you completely change visibility and the way data is framed in public space, you can shape the conversation and change the way people interact and think about the issues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_qz1yXLPIy-Vutxqu.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"justeen-hyde\"><a href=\"http://icommunityhealth.org/about-us/staff/justeen-hyde-phd/\">Justeen Hyde</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://icommunityhealth.org/\">The Institute for Community Health</a> (ICH) is affiliated with three Boston area hospitals with a mission to combine real-world practice with research and evaluation to create healthier communities. Staff sees itself as applied researchers across a range of disciplines from sociology, to ethnography, to fine arts. One of the things ICH is increasingly asked to do is gather more community input. There is a growing recognition of the importance of community input in community health needs assessments. However, the same people get tapped repeatedly to represent the interests and needs of the communities these multiple hospitals serve, which creates some problems. Typical methods involve one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and sometimes surveys. In order to expand the participation, ICH partnered with the <a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/\">Engagement Lab</a> at <a href=\"http://www.emerson.edu/\">Emerson College</a> to utilize the <a href=\"https://communityplanit.org/\">Community PlanIt</a> platform to engage the neighborhoods as a mechanism to engage the community in setting the top priorities for a grant-making process. The primary goal was to better understand the areas of intervention residents thought were most important to focus upon. Community PlanIt is an online game that unfolds over 3 weeks, that includes a mix of challenge questions and social media interactivity (likes, comments) for which players earn coins in the game. These coins could then be allocated by players to small projects (Causes) that would receive funding at the end of the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_AowPulVqi4FHOodr.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://communityplanit.org/healthmatters/\">How did it work?</a> 889 people registered, over 400 actively played. <strong>60% of players reported no prior involvement in community planning processes, which ICH counted as a major success.</strong> ICH used a mix of analytical methods to explore the quantitative and qualitative data. The form of the game allowed for a more continued level of engagement, beyond what is typically available in focus groups or surveys. It was fun! And, people could participate according to their own schedules. However, there were some challenges. The concept of using a game for this kind of work was itself a bit esoteric and somewhat off-putting to some people. A lot of seniors and immigrant populations did not get a chance to play. A feature that ICH and Engagement Lab saw as beneficial, that the game is open access, posed some issues within the context of private hospitals, where data like this is thought of as proprietary. <strong>Such a conservative approach to community data among hospitals leads to inhibitions aboutsharing data, which otherwise could allow the public and other institutions to make the most of it in other ways.</strong> Next time ICH uses such a platform as Community PlanIt, Justeen would have more conversations up front with hospitals about what to do with the data, to think about the ways the data and stories can be shared and utilized more broadly in the community, beyond the internal processes which drove the primary reason for collecting of the data.</p>\n<h1 id=\"don-blair-with-public-lab\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/donwblair\">Don Blair</a> with Public Lab</h1>\n<p>He opens by posing the question: What is the relationship of bias and truth with respect to civic engagement projects? <a href=\"http://publiclab.org/\">Public Lab</a> began out of an aerial<a href=\"http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping\">mapping</a> project after an oil spill, using balloons, kites and digital cameras, and images used to stitch together to make maps. Using Google Maps as a framework, images which were more detailed, higher resolution typically available from Google satellites. The project enabled the public to collect and disperse information using relatively inexpensive tools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_zYXgEwngKDCCUzzH.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now Don is moving in the direction of understanding water quality, by setting up water-quality sensors. One of the problems, is that such data is not as decodable as visual (photographic) data. There’s a need to decode data by collaborating with experts (like hydrologists). There seems to be a tension between engagement and rigor. If you set up structures to ensure scientific rigor, you may find yourself inhibiting engagement by alienating the wider public. He discussed a <a href=\"https://partsandcrafts.org/\">public maker space</a> aimed largely at middle schools students that allows them to use the power tools in the lab unless they have training or adult supervision (“tool restrictions”). <strong>Creating such rules scaffolds the usership and opens a pathway to eventually using them, giving them permission, rather being exclusionary.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6e_fHSRIKIA0Wk5a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don Blair ends with this quote from Parts and Crafts tool restrictions: “I feel a little bit defensive going over this list of tool-restrictions — it feels bad to tell people that they’re not allowed to do stuff, and deep in my heart I think that kids are, in fact, generally capable of handling most of the tools in our space. But we live in a world where we don’t generally give kids tools, don’t generally let them play or work with hot, sharp, or rapidly moving objects. While it might, at first glance, seem ageist and condescending to prohibit kids from using certain kinds of tools, that’s not really what we’re doing with our tool rules. In fact, calling our rules “tool-restrictions” misses the point entirely. <strong>In a context in which kids are generally prohibited from using things that might seem dangerous, a clear policy on what tools can be used under what conditions functions not as a set of restrictions, but an offer of permission.</strong>“</p>\n<p>Due to the late hour, Q+A section of the panel was deferred to informal conversation during lunch. Catherine opened up a number of tensions to consider through the lunch break: scale of projects big data vs individual stories, looking at quantitative data qualitatively and vice versa; the relationship between engagement and rigor. Catherine wants the groups to <strong>keep considering the audience of the research</strong> and its impact on methodology and reporting: <strong>who is the research for?</strong></p>\n","md":"\n### By Engagement Lab\n\n06/11/2015\n\n_This is a liveblog account contributed to by Christina Wilson, Becky Michelson, and Sarah Zaidan at the [Boston Civic Media Metrics &amp; Methods Conference.](https://bostoncivic.media/)_\n\nWhat are the benefits of quantitative versus qualitative research?

This session will feature case studies from scholars who practice a broad range of research styles.\n\nModerator: Catherine D’Ignazio\n\nPresenters: Catherine D’Ignazio,\\*_ Kate Krontiris_,_ Sarah Wiliams_,\\* Matthew Battles,Cris Magliozzi, Dietmar Offenhuber, Justeen Hyde, Don Blair\n\n[Catherine](http://www.emerson.edu/academics/faculty-guide/profile/catherine-d%27ignazio/2463) welcomes the group and introduces the panelists and herself. Boston’s vibrant tech sector, civic environment, scholarly community, and array of community organizers make this a valuable opportunity to bring together various fields, traditions and methods of inquiry about the design of materials for inquiry and collective civic benefit. Each of these groups has different methods for describing and understanding the world, and different audiences that they address. The tension in this panel is to showcase the variety of civic methods among the panelist: [participatory art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_art) , [ethnography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography) , [qualitative data](http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/qualdata.php) , and[citizen science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science). How can we start to coordinate our various efforts in a deliberate and intentional ways to make our cities better: from implementation, to evaluation, to reporting to the public? This conference is the kick-off to the Boston Civic Media Consortium that will begin to give us the chance in Boston to keep exploring these questions over the next three years.\n\nGiven the proliferation of methods, **1) what should our goals for civic engagement be?** (Catherine’s emphasis is on the biggest tent possible. But then, is that too fuzzy?) And then, **2) who is our research for?**\n\n# Catherine D’Ignazio\n\n**Participatory Art + Civic Goals —** Art can be a research method for activating civic imagination and mentions examples like [Steve Lambert’s](http://visitsteve.com/) work. To explore this, Catherine introduces the [Institute for Infinitely Small Things](http://www.ikatun.org/institute/infinitelysmallthings/)(IIST), and a project they did in Cambridge to explore overlooked or ignored aspects of everyday life. [“The City Formerly Known as Cambridge”](http://www.ikatun.org/kanarinka/the-city-formerly-known-as-cambridge/) was a particular project, looking at the names of public places in Cambridge and the dominance of Anglo-Saxon names commemorated on public squares, streets and monuments around Harvard Square. ([Portuguese Alliance](http://www.maps-inc.org/) lobbied for a very long time to get [Cardinal Medeiros Street](http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=400+Cardinal+Medeiros+Ave&amp;city=Cambridge&amp;state=MA&amp;zipcode=02141&amp;redirect=true) named — then misspelled when the sign was put up!) What would the city look like if the present-day community could rename the city with names that mattered to them? IIST hosted “Renaming Parties” in partnership with co-current events around Cambridge to engage the public in conversation about why things were named as they were, and then to submit a new name. Much of the project was about the very construction of the artifice in public to have these conversations. Each person gave their input, story, and address to connect after the new map was created. At the end of two years, an artifact was produced, “A Map of the City Formerly Known as Cambridge.“ Some renamed locations quite personally — for their dog, a family member — but others submitted named related to how spaces are currently used, perhaps to claim space, e.g., Cambridge Common (Freaks), a school that used a grassy common for grazing cows, and then some referenced historical events / business. Some organized groups were in the process of officially changing the name of certain streets, as well. Everyone who submitted a card, submitted a story, and each of these were recorded as references points on the map. **This is just one example of how art can be used to activate civic imagination.** Even though these names did not officially change, it nevertheless allowed participants to** feel a sense of empowerment in collective visioning.**\n\n![A Map of the City Formerly Known as Cambridge by The Institute for Infinitely Small Things](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_uTaJaBQL4CIelPC0.jpg)\n\n# Kate Krontiris\n\nKate identifies herself outside of formal academia, in the intersection of researcher, strategist, and facilitator, exemplified in the work she has done as an applied researcher with a background in public policy and business. Her most recent project, carried out with Google’s Civic Innovation team, is interested in looking at the people in the middle — [“interested by-standers”](http://katekrontiris.com/) — who are interested in civic life, but not taking action. Her team looked at six cities across the US (San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, Phoenix, Chicago, Boston), conducting in depth interviews paired with conjoint quantitative surveys done in those locations. Findings at: [googlepolitics.blogspot.com](http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/). Interesting paradoxes were uncovered about the way this group views their power and engagement choices in civic life.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OYcVPH7PF3G6kh0-.png)\n\nWhen thinking about how to share the findings from the research: 1) inform products and services at Google related to civic life and 2) share with the broader civic tech eco-system to inform their work to activate this interested bystander segment of the population. **The data is meant to help others working in this field better understand the needs and perceptions of the people who would be using the civic tech tools they create.** There is a rigorous internal review process at Google when communicating research publicly, different from the academic review process and reliant on feed-back from the broader community. The work was submitted to [EPIC Conference](http://epicpeople.org/2015/) for presentation and feedback. The feedback they got was jarring, stating that the research was interesting, but not enough informed by a theoretical framework. This critique initially came as a blow to to the Kate and her research team at Google, but then forced them to ask what their original goals were: making a contribution to the applied work going on at this moment in time, not reshaping the theoretical conversation among academics.\n\n**Mixed methods approach** — qualitative and quantitative — the quantitive data from surveys surveys were used to validate signals picked up in the in-depth conversations (qualitative data) and note points of divergence. Currently, she is trying to think of ways to circle back to the qualitative side to bring stories to bear on some of the quantitative findings. Anyone interested in pursuing this kind of work should reach out to Kate.\n\n# [Sarah Williams](https://bostoncivicmedia.hackpad.com/ep/profile/xiCGvKFdyrG)\n\nAs the director of the [Civic Data Design Lab](http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/) Sarah’s work is informed by the question: How can we use data to effect civic policy change? She tells the story of the garment district and rezoning for current use needs. CDDL used data from[tracking fashion workers](http://www.checkinfashion.com/) to show where they were moving in the district and the areas they were most using, in order to shape the rezoning guidelines.\n\n[Another case in Nairobi](http://www.digitalmatatus.com/) looked at the data on [matatus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fybwZ971Sv8) (small minibus taxis), main public transport in the city, low cost (.30 USD/ride), set by drivers. City Council data set was incomplete about where these matatus moved. CDDL leveraged the wide-spread use of cell phones to build out the dataset, using the public (GTFS). There was a concerted engagement process throughout the data collection process with the local technology community, government, academia, the Matatu Owners Association, drivers and NGOs — giving them all a sense of co-ownership in the data, so that it would be used by them. In addition to digital tools, CDDL developed a paper map that everyday citizens could use. They held a hackathon, out of which emerged the app, FlashCast Sonar, and MA3Routewhich relays traffic accidents to help drivers. Subsequently, there was a movement to have these maps adopted as the official maps of the city, working with local government leaders. **When others leverage data created to effect their own policy change, this is what CDDL considers success**. Other cities have adopted the method and to use in other cities, and other apps that use the data related to city planning, local citizens use the data and UN Habitat have been using the data and graphics in their work. Success is when people take on the data of applied research projects and continue to use in in new interventions and products.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_LxayiQ6jLr0mSrcA.png)\n\n# [Matthew Battles](http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/) and Cris Magliozzi [from MetaLab](http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/)\n\nWhat kinds of engagement might be possible, Matthew asks. What are the kinds of methods that drive research interests in the humanities: **exploring and making accessible collections / archives; impact of technologies on these collections; looking historically at these collections at libraries.** [Cold Storage](http://metalab.harvard.edu/2015/02/cold-storage-premiere-today/) project has made media [(short films](http://librarybeyondthebook.org/cold_storage/), interactive website) and technologies to **uncover the invisible infrastructure** at the Harvard Library, the depository system which handles 10 million volumes off-campus, not open to the public. HarvardDirect is the digital tool meant to eventually erase the physical repository space. The depository location in the real world is 30 miles away from campus. First step was to explore the physical space of the depository with architects and designers, and the specific role of this place: temperature controlled designed to preserve books for 500 years. Film documents the activities of the librarians at the depository who do not directly participate in life at Harvard in Cambridge. The* Cold Storage* film was a kind of ethnography designed to bring to light these stories. Subsequently, students in the design seminar have engaged with the Cold Storage research to embark on their own projects with the Harvard depository and its staff — E.g.,[librarybeyondthebook.org](http://librarybeyondthebook.org/) /coldstorage\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_19P6Cmy_iS7KxSdv.png)\n\n# [Dietmar Offenhuber](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/artdesign/people/dietmar-offenhuber/)\n\n**Beyond Truth and Bias: a design-oriented approach to data quantification.**We often take the concept of bias for granted, but Dietmar argues that this is an assumption in the process of knowledge-making that merits exploration. If we only look at data generated by volunteers in terms of “accuracy” instead of in relation to truth and bias, then we might be missing important parts of the story — for example, the impact of the digital divide on the data, which then gets compounded by reporting and representation. The very concept of bias implies access to objective truth. Categories of “truth” / “accuracy” do not always apply to civic media. What do we mean by bias: 1) implicit assumptions — rhetoric about the inherent value of public participation. How does design mediate the conflicts that emerge in the tension between bias and stories told through data? **Implicit assumptions shape design, and design shapes the conversation.** Deitmar is particularly interested in how qualitative information is key to understanding quantitative data — e.g., GPS data is high quantitative, but the notion of “place” is very much qualitatively constructed. In another of his projects, unearthing tone, rhetoric, rationale in the stories surrounding quantitative data points — -e.g., the stories told in See Click Fix reporting — gives new insight into the politics of participation. [Urban Entropy (2015)](http://offenhuber.net/urban-entropy/) installation at Ars Electronica in Austria: if you completely change visibility and the way data is framed in public space, you can shape the conversation and change the way people interact and think about the issues.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_qz1yXLPIy-Vutxqu.jpeg)\n\n# [Justeen Hyde](http://icommunityhealth.org/about-us/staff/justeen-hyde-phd/)\n\n[The Institute for Community Health](http://icommunityhealth.org/) (ICH) is affiliated with three Boston area hospitals with a mission to combine real-world practice with research and evaluation to create healthier communities. Staff sees itself as applied researchers across a range of disciplines from sociology, to ethnography, to fine arts. One of the things ICH is increasingly asked to do is gather more community input. There is a growing recognition of the importance of community input in community health needs assessments. However, the same people get tapped repeatedly to represent the interests and needs of the communities these multiple hospitals serve, which creates some problems. Typical methods involve one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and sometimes surveys. In order to expand the participation, ICH partnered with the [Engagement Lab](http://engagementgamelab.org/) at [Emerson College](http://www.emerson.edu/) to utilize the [Community PlanIt](https://communityplanit.org/) platform to engage the neighborhoods as a mechanism to engage the community in setting the top priorities for a grant-making process. The primary goal was to better understand the areas of intervention residents thought were most important to focus upon. Community PlanIt is an online game that unfolds over 3 weeks, that includes a mix of challenge questions and social media interactivity (likes, comments) for which players earn coins in the game. These coins could then be allocated by players to small projects (Causes) that would receive funding at the end of the game.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_AowPulVqi4FHOodr.png)\n\n[How did it work?](https://communityplanit.org/healthmatters/) 889 people registered, over 400 actively played. **60% of players reported no prior involvement in community planning processes, which ICH counted as a major success.** ICH used a mix of analytical methods to explore the quantitative and qualitative data. The form of the game allowed for a more continued level of engagement, beyond what is typically available in focus groups or surveys. It was fun! And, people could participate according to their own schedules. However, there were some challenges. The concept of using a game for this kind of work was itself a bit esoteric and somewhat off-putting to some people. A lot of seniors and immigrant populations did not get a chance to play. A feature that ICH and Engagement Lab saw as beneficial, that the game is open access, posed some issues within the context of private hospitals, where data like this is thought of as proprietary. **Such a conservative approach to community data among hospitals leads to inhibitions aboutsharing data, which otherwise could allow the public and other institutions to make the most of it in other ways.** Next time ICH uses such a platform as Community PlanIt, Justeen would have more conversations up front with hospitals about what to do with the data, to think about the ways the data and stories can be shared and utilized more broadly in the community, beyond the internal processes which drove the primary reason for collecting of the data.\n\n# [Don Blair](https://twitter.com/donwblair) with Public Lab\n\nHe opens by posing the question: What is the relationship of bias and truth with respect to civic engagement projects? [Public Lab](http://publiclab.org/) began out of an aerial[mapping](http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping) project after an oil spill, using balloons, kites and digital cameras, and images used to stitch together to make maps. Using Google Maps as a framework, images which were more detailed, higher resolution typically available from Google satellites. The project enabled the public to collect and disperse information using relatively inexpensive tools.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_zYXgEwngKDCCUzzH.png)\n\nNow Don is moving in the direction of understanding water quality, by setting up water-quality sensors. One of the problems, is that such data is not as decodable as visual (photographic) data. There’s a need to decode data by collaborating with experts (like hydrologists). There seems to be a tension between engagement and rigor. If you set up structures to ensure scientific rigor, you may find yourself inhibiting engagement by alienating the wider public. He discussed a [public maker space](https://partsandcrafts.org/) aimed largely at middle schools students that allows them to use the power tools in the lab unless they have training or adult supervision (“tool restrictions”). **Creating such rules scaffolds the usership and opens a pathway to eventually using them, giving them permission, rather being exclusionary.**\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6e_fHSRIKIA0Wk5a.jpg)\n\nDon Blair ends with this quote from Parts and Crafts tool restrictions: “I feel a little bit defensive going over this list of tool-restrictions — it feels bad to tell people that they’re not allowed to do stuff, and deep in my heart I think that kids are, in fact, generally capable of handling most of the tools in our space. But we live in a world where we don’t generally give kids tools, don’t generally let them play or work with hot, sharp, or rapidly moving objects. While it might, at first glance, seem ageist and condescending to prohibit kids from using certain kinds of tools, that’s not really what we’re doing with our tool rules. In fact, calling our rules “tool-restrictions” misses the point entirely. **In a context in which kids are generally prohibited from using things that might seem dangerous, a clear policy on what tools can be used under what conditions functions not as a set of restrictions, but an offer of permission.**“\n\nDue to the late hour, Q+A section of the panel was deferred to informal conversation during lunch. Catherine opened up a number of tensions to consider through the lunch break: scale of projects big data vs individual stories, looking at quantitative data qualitatively and vice versa; the relationship between engagement and rigor. Catherine wants the groups to **keep considering the audience of the research** and its impact on methodology and reporting: **who is the research for?**\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2015-12-04T05:00:00Z"},"key":"boston-civic-media-metrics-and-methods-conference-or-session-2-methods","__v":0}

Notably, the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">BlackLivesMatter</a> movement, the Ebola outbreak, and the increasing racialization of politics. Her first question is <em>“What are you doing in your work to respond and reflect on these issues?”</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> says that one of the things they have realized at the <a href=\"http://www.crisismagazine.com/\">Crisis Magazine</a> is that they’ve been doing cover story after cover story about the shooting deaths of unarmed black men. Their goal is to offer historical contextualization for race and power in society. For example, they trace police violence back to slave patrols in Barbados which were then adopted into Southern plantations. This work also draws connections between systematic police brutality and the for-profit incarcertaion system. He clarifies that the journalism done at The Crisis is <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/10/advocacy-is-not-a-dirty-word-in-journalism/\">advocacy journalism</a> for people of color who are systematically disenfranchised. In other words, they speak truth to power. The overriding metaphor is that they are interested in controlling and shaping the narrative. Toni Morrison calls it “the master narrative”. More than resistance, they are interested in aggresivley shaping the media. In his work, he tries to do the same. After the recent incident in McKinney, TX he immediately wrote up a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/jabari-asim/an-incomplete-mckinney-mini-syllabus/10152959144386958?pnref=story\">mini-syllabus</a> on swimming pools as a metaphor for [racist violence against black bodies?] as a way to provide context.</p>\n<p><strong>Terry Marshall,</strong> feels positive that #BlackLivesMatter is about state violence towards black bodies. He mentions that he is himself a survivor of police brutality. At age 15, he was almost shot by a police officer. He was stopped when he started to run, the officer pulled a gun on him and he froze. Since that point, he’s been an activist for black rights and civil rights. Since before Ferguson, he was part of the <a href=\"http://www.intelligentmischief.com/blog/epictumbl-social-hacking-complete\">Black Lives Survival Guide</a>, which came from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> not guitly verdict. Hearing the non-guilty verdict, the focus on the “dangerous black body” of Trayon, and the media narrative that was perpetuated about this, was absurd to him. He started thinking about how to shape these narratives, because the narrative is absurd. “When reality becomes absurd, it’s time to get surreal,” so they started focusing on <a href=\"http://cdn.teehunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zombie-t-shirts.jpg\">zombies</a> as a fantastical correlative, because they are so absurd that you just have to kill them, so we took that perspective on black bodies. That they are so scary and dangerous that you just have kill. And we developed <a href=\"http://www.theblackbodysurvivalguide.com/\">The Black Body Survival Guide</a>, a book of tips for black people, that is absurd and teaches them how to talk and walk so they don’t get shot or abused.</p>\n<p><strong>T<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Landsmark\">ed Landsmark</a></strong> references being an African American who grew up in the projects in East Harlem who met the right people and ended up in law school and eventually running a college. For him, the challenge that faces us in rooms like this nice Microsoft room and our cushy universities — we are privileged — is that you will end up on boards and in places with people of power. Because of this, we have a responsibility to challenge the status quo from within in ways that others cannot. In the decades that he worked on issues of equity in Boston, the number of people of color at places that taught (Harvard, MIT, Mass Art, Northeastern) on staff, faculties, or other positions have not increased significantly in 30–40 years and remains at less than 5% of students and faculty of color. Despite the efforts that we have made, there are others who could provide leadership roles. Part of the job we have is to challenge the status quo. Boston is the only major city in America that has never had a woman or a person of color as mayor. Our boards continue to be dominated by white men. Now it’s not Gillette or GE, it’s tech companies, but the make-up of these places is the same. Can we take a longer-term view of change? Movements imply small steps being taken all the time. The movements tell a story in an authoritative way. How can we go about establishing a clear sense of a counter narrative to authority that provides a clear sense of black men and women in society?</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Amico:</strong> Race is a question that she thinks about a lot. She is a white woman covering violent crime in our neighborhoods, which she says is sometimes a difficult position to be in, vis-a-vis the creation and proliferation of narratives. Who do we invite to be at that table? She was aware of that going into HomicideWatch. Her solution was one that journalists don’t do often enough. When you go to report a story and report some stories — you might feel like you have context but you don’t have the whole narrative.</p>\n<p>And so my question has always been and remains how do we create stories that people have the opportunity to see themselves in, and creating a different sort of journalism than just reporting and publishing. This means acknowledging what we don’t know and the holes in our stories. Laura wants to know what she doesn’t know, and what we (journalists) need to know. Homicide watch rules are simple: record every death, report every death, and tell every story of death. This means that we can document these stories and find ways to report on these stories that give accountability to and for the community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"question-2\">Question 2</h1>\n<p><strong>Susan</strong> says these issues of race are not just those that belong to marginalized groups but belong to everyone here. We have educators, activists and institutions here in the audience.<em>What are the roles of educators and activists in disrupting narratives and in producing change?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> says that you start where you are. What is the particular struggle you can deal with where you are? Since he has been at <a href=\"https://www.emerson.edu/\">Emerson</a>, he has never had an African-American male student in his class. It’s appalling. We can’t even begin to have this conversation if we don’t have different kinds of people in the room. He has opened his office to all students of color on campus and the word has spread. He wants to expand teacher-student relationship beyond the classroom. His office is a safe zone, a free zone. He comes from a personal perspective where he as a father of five, has experienced some of the oppression that is common to African American men and women all around the country. “I always start from where I come from, I remember my isolation as a black student that distracted me from the basic mission I had at college, which was to learn.” He was disappointed and angered at the coverage in which Michael Brown was described as “It looked like a demon”. He pasted that on his office door because it was so offensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Terry</strong> says that everyone needs to do something. There can’t be a type of thinking that this problem is just a black issue. We’re all interdependent, and related to everyone. Another tool for the black life survival guide is the “race card.” The card is meant to be for someone who owns a black body. This is satire that we use to help grieve, and to be a product of a system that promotes a system of suppression, and this card promotes a dialog of real connections to privilege, We need to understand what we can do to promote solidarity as human beings, to show that we are interdependent and interconnected. For any issue, we are connected.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_sjmmw_UF3o7jz_Cm.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Ted</strong> says that Boston is a small and safe city. If you count Boston and Cambridge they amount to about a quarter of the population of Brooklyn. It’s an easy city to get around in. The reality is that most students and faculty never get into Boston to experience it for what it is. Many students have never been to Fenway or the Garden let alone <a href=\"http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/dorchester.asp\">Dorchester</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/missionhill.asp\">Mission Hill</a>. The initial challenge is for us to get students to get out into the city. To feel comfortable being in the city. The demographic of most students is not a working class demographic. The students in prestigious schools have no hint of what it means to be in an urban community interacting with people. One of the first things that should happen is that activists should adopt people from campuses and take students into communities. We should develop understandings of race and class that enable us to be more empathetic. That’s the first thing. The second thing is that we have more smart people in Boston than any other city and yet we use very little of that intellect and data to serve and support communities.</p>\n<p>We also need to teach people how to use media and data for effective and useful purposes. A lot of the data around us is not useful. We need to develop standards and tools for discerning what’s real about life and what isn’t (Media Literacy). We need to learn what’s important to us about race and class and what’s not.</p>\n<p><strong>Laura</strong> thinks about how to pay attention to what She’s listening to. She does a listening audit of where she’s getting her information. Audio, Video, and Twitter are important. The problem is that maybe we have too much to listen to, not too little. Homicide Watch was started because families of homicide victims were paying to keep obituaries online because they needed to keep dialog about what was happening to their families alive and online. They were able to share conversations and listen to each other and think about how the conversations fit together. We need to make sure these tools are being used not only to listen to each other, but to help understand and develop the context of the story.</p>\n<h1 id=\"question-3\">Question 3</h1>\n<p><strong>Susan</strong>’s area of study is media literacy. A lot of the conversations that are happening are mediated through corporations. While many people are versed in using social media, they are not taught how to deconstruct social media. Media literacy is an important tool for everybody to think about the content and the political economy in which it is created. And who is benefitting? The news anchor will say “It’s a horrible video…” but then go on to show Walter Scott getting shot 10–15 times. She does an exercise with students where she assigns them to go be in a room with people where they are the minority. It’s very difficult for them to figure out how to do this. Susan says there are a lot of different channels for us to be media producers and not just consumers. <em>Where do we go and where do we begin?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> says that one of the problems with Ferguson is that the lived experience conflicted with TV accounts. But also there is a drastic decline in diversity in the newsroom. Washington Post and NYT cultural coverage is abysmal. He gives the example of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/arts/television/viola-davis-plays-shonda-rhimess-latest-tough-heroine.html?_r=0\">an article on Shonda Rhimes</a>, which came out right after they <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/12/8558880/new-york-times-layoffs-watch-2014\">laid off the only African American critic</a>, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/felicia_r_lee/index.html\">Felicia Lee</a>. We are up against very few allies on the inside. Some are still countering the narrative but they are in the minority. There is a lot of wacky stuff on social media but there is also wacky stuff in traditional media. Fox News is a comedy channel. Counter the narrative. <a href=\"http://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/frederick-douglass\">Frederick Douglass had a three-word motto: “Agitate, Agitate, Agitate”.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Terry</strong> thinks that <a href=\"http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Revulsion-as-Clip-Shows-US-Police-Throw-Black-Teen-to-Ground-20150607-0019.html\">the 15-year-old bikini clad black body is perceived as a “scary black body.”</a> There is opportunity with social media (i.e. black twitter), that has become a force on the ground for indivduals to develop their own narratives and deploy their own news. I remember when Ferguson happened I saw this information from my friend sending me a photo, and I was still grieiving from Eric Garner, and by a few days later, my friends were telling me to look at Twitter, and who to follow, who were now thought leaders and citizen journalists, because they were documenting the protests live. After the mainstream media said the protests were over the police were still agitating and we kept documenting. We need to take another step. We need to discuss this in a philosophical way. How twitter and youtube are changing the way that humans see things. In addtion to projects like <a href=\"http://www.theblackbodysurvivalguide.com/survival-guide.html\">The Black Body Survival Guide</a>, we need citizen journalism classes in underserved communities, to help build storytellers to reshape and counter the dominant narratives, and to build a networked system that’s not a power narrative, to better shape the narratives that are out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Ted</strong> Landsmark says we need to look at our networks and see how diverse they are. We need to notice our limitations, and fix them. We need to utilize the networks we have to expand and diversify them and to make them matter. Next thing to do is to make sure that your media expression tools are ready to go. You need to be ready to document. “don’t let your battery die” We’ve got access to tools that can enable us to do extraordinary things, as long as the batteries are charged. The tools are transformative, they just need to be ready to be used, and when we need them. There was a famous photo of me that was taken on the last role of film that that photographer had…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Gj7tnC6sQwdwU2nU.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Laura</strong> appreciates the point about diversity. One of her fears is that people like Wes Lowery at the Washington Post are getting let go. What happens then? Building our networks now goes a long way but there’s a lot to do among traditional producers to do the best we can. Not just in the moment but for the long run.</p>\n<h1 id=\"q-from-audience-most-recent-crisis-in-boston-regarding-the-person-being--apparently-the-knife-was-confiscated-by-the-fbi--id-like-to-hear-your-perspective-about-this\">Q from audience: Most recent crisis in Boston regarding the person being — apparently the knife was confiscated by the FBI . I’d like to hear your perspective about this.</h1>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> thinks police statements should be taken with real suspicion. I think we have this disadvantage where the police statement is regarded as truth and we need to dismantle it. Always regard the official narrative with suspicion. Jabari grew up in the neighborhood where Mike Brown was shot down. This narrative repeats itself generation to generation, and it’s always an attitude where the victim is perpetuating a behavior that needs to be corrected. We can’t wait for the facts to shake out, we need to be suspicious, as a default.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan</strong> says that video won’t save us alone. There was a<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all\"> big push after this summer about cameras on cops</a>. Images create trauma but they don’t necessarily create justice. Just because we see it doesn’t mean we address it. If we see it and we still let it happen, then that illuminates a much more difficult issue to pull apart. We’ve been talking about BlackLivesMatter and the reason we talk about black versus white so much is because that is the fundamental unhealed wound in this country. But there is another thing about terrorism — who are the terrorists? There are other questions that make it harder to have those conversations because we are tip-toeing around our way of thinking about terrorists and terrorism. That buzzword chills people’s ability to have the conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ted</strong> picks up on Susan’s point to say that life on the street is not the same as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation\">CSI</a> episode. One thing Ted learned working on gang violence in the mayor’s office is that there normally is an initial image that needs to be contextualized. There is always a more complex and deep story that what is going on in the street. Journalists need to know how to contextualize these stories and see the deeper and more complicated picture. We need to ask ourselves, what else is going on that shaped this context.</p>\n<p><strong>Terry</strong> identifies as Muslim and black. Most people here would disagree that muslim=terrorist. The critique he has of the current blacklives matter movement is is that it is focused on police killings. But we have to go into the question of <strong>policing itself</strong>. The police were stalking him and harassing that man. This is their practice. This is a practice that is leading to unnecessary deaths. At best, this man was killed for something he was thinking. Terry wonders why the officers needed to jump him in public space and put the public in danger. It’s about deconstructing what people see as helpful regarding policing. We need to develop a new way to keep our communities safe.</p>\n<h1 id=\"steve-walter-how-might-academics-and-researchers-help-create-the-story-and-counternarratives-that-will-have-impact-in-the-moment\">Steve Walter: How might academics and researchers help create the story and counternarratives that will have impact in the moment?</h1>\n<p><strong>Ted</strong> says that there is a way of monetizing how we use big data. A lot of people monetize big data, and then leave. We need to think about contributing to social capital in the community, and how we can use “big” data to protect people and help make communities feel stronger. Example: When we wanted to reduce the murder rate in Boston. We actually took an epidemiological position: the difference between treating someone in 7 minutes or 15 minutes was the difference between assault reporting and death reporting. Our solution was more efficient placing of EMTs around the city. That was our version of using big data to save lives. The question is what are we doing to address the key issues around safety? And keeping neighborhoods safe? The data analysis available even in this room (civic media researchers) could make a big difference to addressing safety in neighborhoods, and addressing the big problems we have with young men of color and how they are treated.</p>\n<p><strong>Terry</strong> adds that academic researchers have to make their knowledge relevant to people. This happens through telling stories and translating research in ways that makes it relatable. Relevance is about telling stories. how do you help people understand the research as a narrative. For example, they created a pop-up store where people could come and tell their problems regarding black bodies. This was satire but it was also real. This was a research practice, a participatory action research practice. People should involve the people they are researching in a reciprocal relationship. Academics writing to each other doesn’t make any sense to him. The purpose is to make the world better.</p>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> wants to see a Nate Silver style blog (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/\">538</a>) that does a statistical social media analysis on issues of race and power. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/01/police-commit-1-in-13-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\">Washington Post</a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">Guardian</a> have released smart data stories that are kind of incomplete, and in academia these statistical analyses take five years to publish under peer review, and they become irrelevant, and not timely, and less relevant.</p>\n<h1 id=\"chris-peterson-data-are-manufactured-with-various-definitions-of-metrics-and-methods-there-are-some-problems-that-are-more-amenable-to-data-analysis-what-problems-are-amenable-to-data-analysis-and-what-problems-are-further-away-from-being-understood-by-data-and-need-real-social-action\">Chris Peterson: Data are manufactured, with various definitions of metrics and methods. there are some problems that are more amenable to data analysis. What problems are amenable to data analysis? And what problems are further away from being understood by data, and need real social action.</h1>\n<p><strong>Susan</strong> wonders if a part of it is that where we are already collecting data (public health, policing) might support it. The thing that always gets lost are the intangibles that cannot get quantified. Where is the room for the lived experience and anecdotal evicence? How can researchers start to use that data in a way that equivalent to how big data is used?</p>\n<p>A person in the audience says that there is no state or federal regulation that requires police to report killings.</p>\n<p><strong>Ted</strong> says we know a lot about the victims of police violence. We don’t know as much about the police perpetrators. Who they are and what the gaps are in their education and training? He has seen lots of data and sees lots of stereotypes. That would be an area where big data would be useful to know what we can do to change those attitudes.</p>\n<p><strong>Jabari</strong> says that the <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\">Southern law Poverty Center</a> claimed that white supremacist groups were infiltrating the police 25 years ago.</p>\n<p>An audience member says that the police force is supported by the judicial system which is racist and classist.</p>\n<p><strong>Laura</strong> says that one of the things that fascinated her is that detectives came to her and said they liked the work because they knew what the prosecutors are doing and vice versa. These people are ostensibly in the same department, yet it takes someone from the outside to show them what the other one is doing. What data are we looking for and what are we asking of these departments? How we get this data and get people talking to one another might go a long way.</p>\n<p>An audience member says she is an urban planner and designer and part of a participatory action research think tank at UMass Boston. There is a resistance on the part of researchers to engaging with communities. You have to put yourself out there and build relationships and value that feedback. A lot of the qualitative data is more important than the quantitative data. The other area that needs to be explored is how that data gets watered down over time. They have found startling information that gets shelved. Researchers are in a unique and flexible position of autonomy to tell the whole truth about racism and systemic oppresssion, but sometimes put it upon ourselves not to do so out of fear.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion-to-the-panel-140-characters-from-each-panelist\">Conclusion to the panel, 140 characters from each panelist.</h1>\n<p><strong>Jabari Asim</strong>: Question Authority</p>\n<p><strong>Terry Marshall</strong>: When reality becomes absurd, it’s time to get surreal.

And we developed [The Black Body Survival Guide](http://www.theblackbodysurvivalguide.com/), a book of tips for black people, that is absurd and teaches them how to talk and walk so they don’t get shot or abused.\n\n**T[ed Landsmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Landsmark)** references being an African American who grew up in the projects in East Harlem who met the right people and ended up in law school and eventually running a college. For him, the challenge that faces us in rooms like this nice Microsoft room and our cushy universities — we are privileged — is that you will end up on boards and in places with people of power. Because of this, we have a responsibility to challenge the status quo from within in ways that others cannot. In the decades that he worked on issues of equity in Boston, the number of people of color at places that taught (Harvard, MIT, Mass Art, Northeastern) on staff, faculties, or other positions have not increased significantly in 30–40 years and remains at less than 5% of students and faculty of color. Despite the efforts that we have made, there are others who could provide leadership roles. Part of the job we have is to challenge the status quo. Boston is the only major city in America that has never had a woman or a person of color as mayor. Our boards continue to be dominated by white men. Now it’s not Gillette or GE, it’s tech companies, but the make-up of these places is the same. Can we take a longer-term view of change? Movements imply small steps being taken all the time. The movements tell a story in an authoritative way. How can we go about establishing a clear sense of a counter narrative to authority that provides a clear sense of black men and women in society?\n\n**Laura Amico:** Race is a question that she thinks about a lot. She is a white woman covering violent crime in our neighborhoods, which she says is sometimes a difficult position to be in, vis-a-vis the creation and proliferation of narratives. Who do we invite to be at that table? She was aware of that going into HomicideWatch. Her solution was one that journalists don’t do often enough. When you go to report a story and report some stories — you might feel like you have context but you don’t have the whole narrative.\n\nAnd so my question has always been and remains how do we create stories that people have the opportunity to see themselves in, and creating a different sort of journalism than just reporting and publishing. This means acknowledging what we don’t know and the holes in our stories. Laura wants to know what she doesn’t know, and what we (journalists) need to know. Homicide watch rules are simple: record every death, report every death, and tell every story of death. This means that we can document these stories and find ways to report on these stories that give accountability to and for the community.\n\n# Question 2\n\n**Susan** says these issues of race are not just those that belong to marginalized groups but belong to everyone here. We have educators, activists and institutions here in the audience._What are the roles of educators and activists in disrupting narratives and in producing change?_\n\n**Jabari** says that you start where you are. What is the particular struggle you can deal with where you are? Since he has been at [Emerson](https://www.emerson.edu/), he has never had an African-American male student in his class. It’s appalling. We can’t even begin to have this conversation if we don’t have different kinds of people in the room. He has opened his office to all students of color on campus and the word has spread. He wants to expand teacher-student relationship beyond the classroom. His office is a safe zone, a free zone. He comes from a personal perspective where he as a father of five, has experienced some of the oppression that is common to African American men and women all around the country. “I always start from where I come from, I remember my isolation as a black student that distracted me from the basic mission I had at college, which was to learn.” He was disappointed and angered at the coverage in which Michael Brown was described as “It looked like a demon”. He pasted that on his office door because it was so offensive.\n\n**Terry** says that everyone needs to do something. There can’t be a type of thinking that this problem is just a black issue. We’re all interdependent, and related to everyone. Another tool for the black life survival guide is the “race card.” The card is meant to be for someone who owns a black body. This is satire that we use to help grieve, and to be a product of a system that promotes a system of suppression, and this card promotes a dialog of real connections to privilege, We need to understand what we can do to promote solidarity as human beings, to show that we are interdependent and interconnected. For any issue, we are connected.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_sjmmw_UF3o7jz_Cm.png)\n\n**Ted** says that Boston is a small and safe city. If you count Boston and Cambridge they amount to about a quarter of the population of Brooklyn. It’s an easy city to get around in. The reality is that most students and faculty never get into Boston to experience it for what it is. Many students have never been to Fenway or the Garden let alone [Dorchester](http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/dorchester.asp) or [Mission Hill](http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/missionhill.asp). The initial challenge is for us to get students to get out into the city. To feel comfortable being in the city. The demographic of most students is not a working class demographic. The students in prestigious schools have no hint of what it means to be in an urban community interacting with people. One of the first things that should happen is that activists should adopt people from campuses and take students into communities. We should develop understandings of race and class that enable us to be more empathetic. That’s the first thing. The second thing is that we have more smart people in Boston than any other city and yet we use very little of that intellect and data to serve and support communities.\n\nWe also need to teach people how to use media and data for effective and useful purposes. A lot of the data around us is not useful. We need to develop standards and tools for discerning what’s real about life and what isn’t (Media Literacy). We need to learn what’s important to us about race and class and what’s not.\n\n**Laura** thinks about how to pay attention to what She’s listening to. She does a listening audit of where she’s getting her information. Audio, Video, and Twitter are important. The problem is that maybe we have too much to listen to, not too little. Homicide Watch was started because families of homicide victims were paying to keep obituaries online because they needed to keep dialog about what was happening to their families alive and online. They were able to share conversations and listen to each other and think about how the conversations fit together. We need to make sure these tools are being used not only to listen to each other, but to help understand and develop the context of the story.\n\n# Question 3\n\n**Susan**’s area of study is media literacy. A lot of the conversations that are happening are mediated through corporations. While many people are versed in using social media, they are not taught how to deconstruct social media. Media literacy is an important tool for everybody to think about the content and the political economy in which it is created. And who is benefitting? The news anchor will say “It’s a horrible video…” but then go on to show Walter Scott getting shot 10–15 times. She does an exercise with students where she assigns them to go be in a room with people where they are the minority. It’s very difficult for them to figure out how to do this. Susan says there are a lot of different channels for us to be media producers and not just consumers. _Where do we go and where do we begin?_\n\n**Jabari** says that one of the problems with Ferguson is that the lived experience conflicted with TV accounts. But also there is a drastic decline in diversity in the newsroom. Washington Post and NYT cultural coverage is abysmal. He gives the example of [an article on Shonda Rhimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/arts/television/viola-davis-plays-shonda-rhimess-latest-tough-heroine.html?_r=0), which came out right after they [laid off the only African American critic](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/12/8558880/new-york-times-layoffs-watch-2014), [Felicia Lee](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/felicia_r_lee/index.html). We are up against very few allies on the inside. Some are still countering the narrative but they are in the minority. There is a lot of wacky stuff on social media but there is also wacky stuff in traditional media. Fox News is a comedy channel. Counter the narrative. [Frederick Douglass had a three-word motto: “Agitate, Agitate, Agitate”.](http://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/frederick-douglass)\n\n**Terry** thinks that [the 15-year-old bikini clad black body is perceived as a “scary black body.”](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Revulsion-as-Clip-Shows-US-Police-Throw-Black-Teen-to-Ground-20150607-0019.html) There is opportunity with social media (i.e. black twitter), that has become a force on the ground for indivduals to develop their own narratives and deploy their own news. I remember when Ferguson happened I saw this information from my friend sending me a photo, and I was still grieiving from Eric Garner, and by a few days later, my friends were telling me to look at Twitter, and who to follow, who were now thought leaders and citizen journalists, because they were documenting the protests live. After the mainstream media said the protests were over the police were still agitating and we kept documenting. We need to take another step. We need to discuss this in a philosophical way. How twitter and youtube are changing the way that humans see things. In addtion to projects like [The Black Body Survival Guide](http://www.theblackbodysurvivalguide.com/survival-guide.html), we need citizen journalism classes in underserved communities, to help build storytellers to reshape and counter the dominant narratives, and to build a networked system that’s not a power narrative, to better shape the narratives that are out there.\n\n**Ted** Landsmark says we need to look at our networks and see how diverse they are. We need to notice our limitations, and fix them. We need to utilize the networks we have to expand and diversify them and to make them matter. Next thing to do is to make sure that your media expression tools are ready to go. You need to be ready to document. “don’t let your battery die” We’ve got access to tools that can enable us to do extraordinary things, as long as the batteries are charged. The tools are transformative, they just need to be ready to be used, and when we need them. There was a famous photo of me that was taken on the last role of film that that photographer had…\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Gj7tnC6sQwdwU2nU.png)\n\n**Laura** appreciates the point about diversity. One of her fears is that people like Wes Lowery at the Washington Post are getting let go. What happens then? Building our networks now goes a long way but there’s a lot to do among traditional producers to do the best we can. Not just in the moment but for the long run.\n\n# Q from audience: Most recent crisis in Boston regarding the person being — apparently the knife was confiscated by the FBI . I’d like to hear your perspective about this.\n\n**Jabari** thinks police statements should be taken with real suspicion. I think we have this disadvantage where the police statement is regarded as truth and we need to dismantle it. Always regard the official narrative with suspicion. Jabari grew up in the neighborhood where Mike Brown was shot down. This narrative repeats itself generation to generation, and it’s always an attitude where the victim is perpetuating a behavior that needs to be corrected. We can’t wait for the facts to shake out, we need to be suspicious, as a default.\n\n**Susan** says that video won’t save us alone. There was a[ big push after this summer about cameras on cops](https://www.aclu.org/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all). Images create trauma but they don’t necessarily create justice. Just because we see it doesn’t mean we address it. If we see it and we still let it happen, then that illuminates a much more difficult issue to pull apart. We’ve been talking about BlackLivesMatter and the reason we talk about black versus white so much is because that is the fundamental unhealed wound in this country. But there is another thing about terrorism — who are the terrorists? There are other questions that make it harder to have those conversations because we are tip-toeing around our way of thinking about terrorists and terrorism. That buzzword chills people’s ability to have the conversation.\n\n**Ted** picks up on Susan’s point to say that life on the street is not the same as a [CSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation) episode. One thing Ted learned working on gang violence in the mayor’s office is that there normally is an initial image that needs to be contextualized. There is always a more complex and deep story that what is going on in the street. Journalists need to know how to contextualize these stories and see the deeper and more complicated picture. We need to ask ourselves, what else is going on that shaped this context.\n\n**Terry** identifies as Muslim and black. Most people here would disagree that muslim=terrorist. The critique he has of the current blacklives matter movement is is that it is focused on police killings. But we have to go into the question of **policing itself**. The police were stalking him and harassing that man. This is their practice. This is a practice that is leading to unnecessary deaths. At best, this man was killed for something he was thinking. Terry wonders why the officers needed to jump him in public space and put the public in danger. It’s about deconstructing what people see as helpful regarding policing. We need to develop a new way to keep our communities safe.\n\n# Steve Walter: How might academics and researchers help create the story and counternarratives that will have impact in the moment?\n\n**Ted** says that there is a way of monetizing how we use big data. A lot of people monetize big data, and then leave. We need to think about contributing to social capital in the community, and how we can use “big” data to protect people and help make communities feel stronger. Example: When we wanted to reduce the murder rate in Boston. We actually took an epidemiological position: the difference between treating someone in 7 minutes or 15 minutes was the difference between assault reporting and death reporting. Our solution was more efficient placing of EMTs around the city. That was our version of using big data to save lives. The question is what are we doing to address the key issues around safety? And keeping neighborhoods safe? The data analysis available even in this room (civic media researchers) could make a big difference to addressing safety in neighborhoods, and addressing the big problems we have with young men of color and how they are treated.\n\n**Terry** adds that academic researchers have to make their knowledge relevant to people. This happens through telling stories and translating research in ways that makes it relatable. Relevance is about telling stories. how do you help people understand the research as a narrative. For example, they created a pop-up store where people could come and tell their problems regarding black bodies. This was satire but it was also real. This was a research practice, a participatory action research practice. People should involve the people they are researching in a reciprocal relationship. Academics writing to each other doesn’t make any sense to him. The purpose is to make the world better.\n\n**Jabari** wants to see a Nate Silver style blog ([538](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)) that does a statistical social media analysis on issues of race and power. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/01/police-commit-1-in-13-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/)and [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database) have released smart data stories that are kind of incomplete, and in academia these statistical analyses take five years to publish under peer review, and they become irrelevant, and not timely, and less relevant.\n\n# Chris Peterson: Data are manufactured, with various definitions of metrics and methods. there are some problems that are more amenable to data analysis. What problems are amenable to data analysis? And what problems are further away from being understood by data, and need real social action.\n\n**Susan** wonders if a part of it is that where we are already collecting data (public health, policing) might support it. The thing that always gets lost are the intangibles that cannot get quantified. Where is the room for the lived experience and anecdotal evicence? How can researchers start to use that data in a way that equivalent to how big data is used?\n\nA person in the audience says that there is no state or federal regulation that requires police to report killings.\n\n**Ted** says we know a lot about the victims of police violence. We don’t know as much about the police perpetrators. Who they are and what the gaps are in their education and training? He has seen lots of data and sees lots of stereotypes. That would be an area where big data would be useful to know what we can do to change those attitudes.\n\n**Jabari** says that the [Southern law Poverty Center](http://www.splcenter.org/) claimed that white supremacist groups were infiltrating the police 25 years ago.\n\nAn audience member says that the police force is supported by the judicial system which is racist and classist.\n\n**Laura** says that one of the things that fascinated her is that detectives came to her and said they liked the work because they knew what the prosecutors are doing and vice versa. These people are ostensibly in the same department, yet it takes someone from the outside to show them what the other one is doing. What data are we looking for and what are we asking of these departments? How we get this data and get people talking to one another might go a long way.\n\nAn audience member says she is an urban planner and designer and part of a participatory action research think tank at UMass Boston. There is a resistance on the part of researchers to engaging with communities. You have to put yourself out there and build relationships and value that feedback. A lot of the qualitative data is more important than the quantitative data. The other area that needs to be explored is how that data gets watered down over time. They have found startling information that gets shelved. Researchers are in a unique and flexible position of autonomy to tell the whole truth about racism and systemic oppresssion, but sometimes put it upon ourselves not to do so out of fear.\n\n# Conclusion to the panel, 140 characters from each panelist.\n\n**Jabari Asim**: Question Authority\n\n**Terry Marshall**: When reality becomes absurd, it’s time to get surreal.

Last week, they hosted the “New Civics Practitioners Conference”: the first conference of it’s kind bringing together ~200 civic education leaders, youth program workers, and educators nationwide. In collaboration with the <a href=\"http://actioncivicscollaborative.org/\">National Action Civics Collaborative</a>, the conference was conceived of to address capacity building for educators to support empowering civic participation for youth amidst the rapidly changing democratic and technology-saturated landscape. The conference organizers aimed to provide, “comprehensive exposure to a range of new civics instruction: from action civics to youth media production, from digital civic learning to controversial issues debates.”</p>\n<p>With the generous support of the Knight Foundation and the McCormick Foundation, the first day of the conference featured an in-depth look at the Mikva Challenge’s <a href=\"https://www.mikvachallenge.org/product/issues-to-action-curriculum/\">Issues to Action Curriculum</a> with the second day focusing on workshops and sessions facilitated by some of the leading civic organizations. Some of the organizations represented included forward-thinking groups such as: <a href=\"http://www.earthforce.org/\">Earth Force</a>, the <a href=\"http://uccollab.org/\">University Community Collaborative</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/generationcitizen\">Generation Citizen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.generationnation.org/\">Generation Nation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.icivics.org/\">iCivics</a>, <a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\">Participatory Budgeting Project</a>,<a href=\"https://www.facinghistory.org/\">Facing History</a>, <a href=\"http://chicagofreedomschool.org/\">Chicago Freedom School</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/civicmissionofschools\">Civic Mission of Schools</a>,<a href=\"http://www.youthonboard.org/\">Youth on Board</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/\">News Literacy Project</a>, <a href=\"http://www.citizenship-aei.org/2012/09/chicagos-global-citizenship-initiative/#.VZFcMO1VhHw\">CPS Global Citizenship Initiative</a>,<a href=\"http://www.procon.org/\">Pro Con</a>, <a href=\"http://www.generationnation.org/\">Generation Nation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.generationnation.org/\">CRFC</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/\">Smart Chicago</a>.</p>\n<p>The dive into Mikva’s curriculum was led by Chicago-based teachers with years of experience implementing this resource. Participants, who were largely teachers from <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/about/communities/\">the twenty-six Knight Resident Communities</a>, worked in small groups to complete key activities from each stage in the curriculum, which takes students from an exploration of their communities to implementation (and reflection on) action to impact local decision makers. One of the curriculum’s key strategies is for students to explore their own values in the context of community to develop intention for change and leadership. Mikva shared <a href=\"https://www.mikvachallenge.org/educators/online-resources/issues/project-soapbox/\">videos</a> of students making short, powerful speeches about the social problems that affect them. The curriculum takes students through a variety of research methods, a power analysis, and an assessment of different strategies to impact decision makers. The lunch break featured student panelists speaking about their own action civic projects, including a team of high school juniors who designed a series of workshops for first year students about healthy relationships, ranging from romance to bullying. The plenary speaker at the day’s end was <a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/23815\">Diane Hess</a>, Dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Senior Vice President of the Spencer Foundation. She described our country’s growing political polarization and her research on the positive impact of classroom discussion about controversial political issues in seeding students with the skills for democratic life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Fc4zewThNdl4u9Uc.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; Where do you want to make power visible to students, so they can become students of power? @MikvaBrian @MikvaChallenge #newcivics\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/actioncivicsla/status/613757040901640193\">@actioncivicsla</a></p></p>\n<p>&gt; @CommonSense has great resources for teaching reliable online research. #newcivics @MikvaChallenge @actioncivicsla\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/euhedral/status/613753963314343936\">@euhedral</a></p></p>\n<p>&gt; &quot;Democracy needs to be reborn in each generation and education is its midwife.&quot; S/O to all the midwives at this conference! #NewCivics2015\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoaguayo1/status/613710335434817536\">@bertoaguayo1</a></p></p>\n<p><em>New Civics Practitioners Conference tweets: sharing resources and reflecting on the need for a renewed civics</em></p>\n<p>The Engagement Lab was asked to participate because many of our projects are youth-centered or designed intentionally to include youth participation. For instance, in our Cape Cod game of Community PlanIt, one of the winners was a young man with an environmental sensing project. We strive to build games for an intergenerational audience because we believe that youth need to feel like their input is being taken seriously and can be integrated into larger civic engagement efforts accordingly. The more that games or curricula can supplement existing real-world decision-making processes, the more respected and valued participants can feel.</p>\n<p>This year, civic curriculum resources, including the game-based <a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/games/emerging-citizens/\">Emerging Citizens</a> curriculum and <a href=\"http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/learning-guide\">the learning guide for the Civic Media Project</a>have had more of a focus. The modular, downloadable Emerging Citizens curriculum offers a playful and interactive approach for critically reviewing and creating media. Meanwhile, the learning guide provides accessible prompts and activities for learning about media used civically and its influence on engagement. Both projects help youth to make connections between local and global issues while considering solutions to real-world problems.

Panel participants included the Engagement Lab, the Smart Chicago Collaborative, and the Mikva Challenge.</p>\n<p>One of the panel’s first prompts was to define digital activism for the participants who included teachers, principals, and youth program managers. The afternoon session’s definition stressed how activism has had the same timeless tactics of petition signing, awareness raising, and advocacy for centuries: the digital tools are simply a new vehicle for achieving those ends. Unique Digital methods afford greater amplification of messages and offer opportunities for creative storytelling. Several unique affordances of digital activism include growing trends of civic crowdfunding and citizen journalism as well as viral media production such as memefication, satire, parody videos, etc.</p>\n<p>Some of the themes that emerged from the panel included: translating awareness raised technologically into action, bridging personal use of technology with outward facing use, and discerning effective applications of technology. The panel was a good opportunity for educators to share some common anxieties that arise when considering how to integrate technology in a meaningful ways for students and communities. Some of the concerns included: how to keep up with the constant onslaught of new technologies and how to empower students to be creators and not just consumers of media. Chris Rudd, Youth Program Director at Mikva Challenge, shared how he supports meeting youth half way by embracing the tools they most frequently use. He often creates hashtags unique to the programs he’s facilitating and encourages tweeting in the classroom as a way to engage with the content and process things like guest speaker presentations. While Chris actively incorporates social media in his classrooms, he stressed that he often hears educators asking about “using Twitter correctly.” “There is no correct way to use technology,” Chris explained, “don’t be afraid to use technology at your comfort level and pace. There aren’t an ideal amount of tweets per day. If anything, Twitter serves as a great archive of conversations.”</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the panel, educators shared resources with each other after asking questions like, “Is there anything that brings a lot of the digital engagement tools into one place?”. Resources such as <a href=\"https://www.edmodo.com/\">Edmodo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.safarimontage.com/\">Safari Montage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.schoology.com/home.php\">Schoolology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.symbaloo.com/\">Symbaloo</a>, <a href=\"https://groupme.com/\">GroupMe</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.remind.com/\"> Remind101</a> were shared. Check out the resources section at the bottom of this post for more tools and sites.** Though the conversation continued energetically after the panel ended, one of the last points touched upon how engaging youth in emerging technologies helps demonstrate how technology design much more than simply coding. Sonja Marziano of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, shared an upcoming summer program for youth to develop technology projects for issues they care about. The program will help illustrate that beyond coding, tech projects often require design, research, marketing, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_jo6_vfkh2ycjU-gN.png\" alt=\"Digital Activism Panel, morning session panel participants: Jedd Cohen, The Engagement Lab, Dan O’Neil, Smart Chicago, Chris Rudd, Mikva Challenge. Moderated by: Lisa Kim\"></p>\n<p>Engagement Lab staff was also able to attend the workshop run by Boston-based Youth on Board (YOB) about the approach that guided the creation of their <a href=\"http://www.bostonstudentrights.org/#/app/item/2\">Know Your Rights app</a> for students.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_a6mceb-2aBIFaPOF.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The adult and teen staff lead participants through activities exploring three ingredients to successful practice of action civics: Social Emotional Learning (SEL), student-directed learning, and claiming space for action civics. SEL is particularly important because it provides a strong foundation for anti-oppression work, which requires confronting difficult emotions, and creates the basis for democratic process in the classroom. Also cited was the <a href=\"http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/1170959/6c1762e388/546413979/513de83b44/\">Susan Brown Exchange’s Social Emotional Learning Challenge</a>, which has an upcoming report highlighting strategies used by a handful of practitioners around the country, including YOB. Student-directed learning guides the agenda for action civics work, so staff shared their outline for youth participatory action research, a practice at the heart of the Emerging Citizens Curriculum.

Last week, they hosted the “New Civics Practitioners Conference”: the first conference of it’s kind bringing together ~200 civic education leaders, youth program workers, and educators nationwide. In collaboration with the [National Action Civics Collaborative](http://actioncivicscollaborative.org/), the conference was conceived of to address capacity building for educators to support empowering civic participation for youth amidst the rapidly changing democratic and technology-saturated landscape. The conference organizers aimed to provide, “comprehensive exposure to a range of new civics instruction: from action civics to youth media production, from digital civic learning to controversial issues debates.”\n\nWith the generous support of the Knight Foundation and the McCormick Foundation, the first day of the conference featured an in-depth look at the Mikva Challenge’s [Issues to Action Curriculum](https://www.mikvachallenge.org/product/issues-to-action-curriculum/) with the second day focusing on workshops and sessions facilitated by some of the leading civic organizations. Some of the organizations represented included forward-thinking groups such as: [Earth Force](http://www.earthforce.org/), the [University Community Collaborative](http://uccollab.org/), [Generation Citizen](https://www.facebook.com/generationcitizen), [Generation Nation](http://www.generationnation.org/), [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/), [Participatory Budgeting Project](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/),[Facing History](https://www.facinghistory.org/), [Chicago Freedom School](http://chicagofreedomschool.org/), [Civic Mission of Schools](https://www.facebook.com/civicmissionofschools),[Youth on Board](http://www.youthonboard.org/), [News Literacy Project](http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/), [CPS Global Citizenship Initiative](http://www.citizenship-aei.org/2012/09/chicagos-global-citizenship-initiative/#.VZFcMO1VhHw),[Pro Con](http://www.procon.org/), [Generation Nation](http://www.generationnation.org/), [CRFC](http://www.generationnation.org/), and [Smart Chicago](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/).\n\nThe dive into Mikva’s curriculum was led by Chicago-based teachers with years of experience implementing this resource. Participants, who were largely teachers from [the twenty-six Knight Resident Communities](http://www.knightfoundation.org/about/communities/), worked in small groups to complete key activities from each stage in the curriculum, which takes students from an exploration of their communities to implementation (and reflection on) action to impact local decision makers. One of the curriculum’s key strategies is for students to explore their own values in the context of community to develop intention for change and leadership. Mikva shared [videos](https://www.mikvachallenge.org/educators/online-resources/issues/project-soapbox/) of students making short, powerful speeches about the social problems that affect them. The curriculum takes students through a variety of research methods, a power analysis, and an assessment of different strategies to impact decision makers. The lunch break featured student panelists speaking about their own action civic projects, including a team of high school juniors who designed a series of workshops for first year students about healthy relationships, ranging from romance to bullying. The plenary speaker at the day’s end was [Diane Hess](http://www.news.wisc.edu/23815), Dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Senior Vice President of the Spencer Foundation. She described our country’s growing political polarization and her research on the positive impact of classroom discussion about controversial political issues in seeding students with the skills for democratic life.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Fc4zewThNdl4u9Uc.png)\n\n&gt; Where do you want to make power visible to students, so they can become students of power? @MikvaBrian @MikvaChallenge #newcivics\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/actioncivicsla/status/613757040901640193\">@actioncivicsla</a></p>\n\n&gt; @CommonSense has great resources for teaching reliable online research. #newcivics @MikvaChallenge @actioncivicsla\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/euhedral/status/613753963314343936\">@euhedral</a></p>\n\n&gt; \"Democracy needs to be reborn in each generation and education is its midwife.\" S/O to all the midwives at this conference! #NewCivics2015\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoaguayo1/status/613710335434817536\">@bertoaguayo1</a></p>\n\n_New Civics Practitioners Conference tweets: sharing resources and reflecting on the need for a renewed civics_\n\nThe Engagement Lab was asked to participate because many of our projects are youth-centered or designed intentionally to include youth participation. For instance, in our Cape Cod game of Community PlanIt, one of the winners was a young man with an environmental sensing project. We strive to build games for an intergenerational audience because we believe that youth need to feel like their input is being taken seriously and can be integrated into larger civic engagement efforts accordingly. The more that games or curricula can supplement existing real-world decision-making processes, the more respected and valued participants can feel.\n\nThis year, civic curriculum resources, including the game-based [Emerging Citizens](http://engagementgamelab.org/games/emerging-citizens/) curriculum and [the learning guide for the Civic Media Project](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/learning-guide)have had more of a focus. The modular, downloadable Emerging Citizens curriculum offers a playful and interactive approach for critically reviewing and creating media. Meanwhile, the learning guide provides accessible prompts and activities for learning about media used civically and its influence on engagement. Both projects help youth to make connections between local and global issues while considering solutions to real-world problems. Read more about our media literacy and global change initiatives [here](http://engagementgamelab.org/initiatives/#medialit).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_V2YIsijP3Z5O85px.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_R9SnmiWcG3L5aAuQ.png)\n\nThe second day of the New Civics Practitioners conference featured two sessions of the Digital Activism panel- to facilitate discussions about the use of emerging technologies for awareness-raising, advocacy, and effective civic participation. Panel participants included the Engagement Lab, the Smart Chicago Collaborative, and the Mikva Challenge.\n\nOne of the panel’s first prompts was to define digital activism for the participants who included teachers, principals, and youth program managers. The afternoon session’s definition stressed how activism has had the same timeless tactics of petition signing, awareness raising, and advocacy for centuries: the digital tools are simply a new vehicle for achieving those ends. Unique Digital methods afford greater amplification of messages and offer opportunities for creative storytelling. Several unique affordances of digital activism include growing trends of civic crowdfunding and citizen journalism as well as viral media production such as memefication, satire, parody videos, etc.\n\nSome of the themes that emerged from the panel included: translating awareness raised technologically into action, bridging personal use of technology with outward facing use, and discerning effective applications of technology. The panel was a good opportunity for educators to share some common anxieties that arise when considering how to integrate technology in a meaningful ways for students and communities. Some of the concerns included: how to keep up with the constant onslaught of new technologies and how to empower students to be creators and not just consumers of media. Chris Rudd, Youth Program Director at Mikva Challenge, shared how he supports meeting youth half way by embracing the tools they most frequently use. He often creates hashtags unique to the programs he’s facilitating and encourages tweeting in the classroom as a way to engage with the content and process things like guest speaker presentations. While Chris actively incorporates social media in his classrooms, he stressed that he often hears educators asking about “using Twitter correctly.” “There is no correct way to use technology,” Chris explained, “don’t be afraid to use technology at your comfort level and pace. There aren’t an ideal amount of tweets per day. If anything, Twitter serves as a great archive of conversations.”\n\nTowards the end of the panel, educators shared resources with each other after asking questions like, “Is there anything that brings a lot of the digital engagement tools into one place?”. Resources such as [Edmodo](https://www.edmodo.com/), [Safari Montage](http://www.safarimontage.com/), [Schoolology](https://www.schoology.com/home.php), [Symbaloo](https://www.symbaloo.com/), [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/), and[ Remind101](https://www.remind.com/) were shared. Check out the resources section at the bottom of this post for more tools and sites.\\*\\* Though the conversation continued energetically after the panel ended, one of the last points touched upon how engaging youth in emerging technologies helps demonstrate how technology design much more than simply coding. Sonja Marziano of the Smart Chicago Collaborative, shared an upcoming summer program for youth to develop technology projects for issues they care about. The program will help illustrate that beyond coding, tech projects often require design, research, marketing, etc.\n\n![Digital Activism Panel, morning session panel participants: Jedd Cohen, The Engagement Lab, Dan O’Neil, Smart Chicago, Chris Rudd, Mikva Challenge. Moderated by: Lisa Kim](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_jo6_vfkh2ycjU-gN.png)\n\nEngagement Lab staff was also able to attend the workshop run by Boston-based Youth on Board (YOB) about the approach that guided the creation of their [Know Your Rights app](http://www.bostonstudentrights.org/#/app/item/2) for students.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_a6mceb-2aBIFaPOF.png)\n\nThe adult and teen staff lead participants through activities exploring three ingredients to successful practice of action civics: Social Emotional Learning (SEL), student-directed learning, and claiming space for action civics. SEL is particularly important because it provides a strong foundation for anti-oppression work, which requires confronting difficult emotions, and creates the basis for democratic process in the classroom. Also cited was the [Susan Brown Exchange’s Social Emotional Learning Challenge](http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/1170959/6c1762e388/546413979/513de83b44/), which has an upcoming report highlighting strategies used by a handful of practitioners around the country, including YOB. Student-directed learning guides the agenda for action civics work, so staff shared their outline for youth participatory action research, a practice at the heart of the Emerging Citizens Curriculum. YOB explained that claiming space for action civics is critical because of reduced funding and other threats to civic learning, in Boston and elsewhere. For the past two years, Boston Public Schools has moved to combine Social Studies and English Language Arts into a single Humanities department.\n\nThe jam-packed two day conference left many inspired to apply the lessons and reflections in their education communities back home. Our lab was most stimulated by learning from educators that have thriving youth empowerment programs due to support from administrators, legislators, and influential community stakeholders. We realize that a new civics movement is one that is interdisciplinary, collaborative, and embracing of youth-led ideas and technologies and are excited to keep developing projects that support this model.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_SdawGJ7z1cUkyI5w.png)\n\n_More Resources Mentioned in the Digital Activism Panel_\n\n-   [Thunderclap](https://www.thunderclap.it/)- amplify awareness raising campaigns and messages through crowd-support\n\n-   [Expunge.io](http://www.expunge.io/) — help youth expunge juvenile records\n\n-   [Storify](https://storify.com/)- a useful tool for reflection that allows you to aggregate social media content into single narrative\n\n-   [Mozilla Popcorn Webmaker](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/)- you can remix youtube, soundcloud, vimeo content and more\n\n-   [Mozilla X-Ray Goggles](https://webmaker.org/en-US/goggles)- you can inspect and play with the code of any page\n\n-   Teacher-friendly resources include:\n\n-   [ascd.org](http://www.ascd.org/Default.aspx)\n\n-   [educational leadership](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership.aspx) journal,\n\n-   [Apps, Apps Everywhere: Are any Good, You think?](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may15/vol72/num08/Apps,-Apps-Everywhere@-Are-Any-Good,-You-Think%C2%A2.aspx)- a list of 11 apps\n\n-   [Newsela.com](https://newsela.com/): daily news for your classroom\n\n_Ways to Document learning:_\n\n-   [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com/ep/account/sign-in)\n\n-   [Googledocs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)\n\n-   [Slack](https://slack.com/)\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2015-12-08T05:00:00Z"},"key":"digital-activism-panel-reflections-from-the-new-civics-practitioners-conference","__v":0}

Every Thursday night at the Engagement Lab 10+ students, faculty, and local game enthusiasts would gather in our common space to play and discuss alternative games in a semi-formal setting.</p>\n<p>Each week we would play a new indie/art game or collection of games and discuss theme, design (technical and artistic), and rhetoric. Through contemporary and relevant game studies readings that were specifically aligned with the games being played, we explored the games in context of the discourse in which they were created. The games we discussed in this event series typically fly under the normal “gamer” radar and push the boundaries of what digital games are and can be.</p>\n<p>I had two main goals in mind when starting this group:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Generate a community at Emerson that participates in an ongoing critical engagement with the contemporary indie game discourse.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provide an outlet for Emerson students who are interested not just in playing games together, but talking about games together, in an environment that bridges the gap between a formal class and a free form club.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are many meetups and workshops that help connect designers to audiences or designers to other designers, but there are hardly any local groups at Emerson and in the wider Boston community that explores surrounding culture from a critical distance . Ultimately I wanted there to be a place at Emerson for students, faculty, and local game creators/critics/designers to meet in an informal setting to play, talk, and critically engage one another.</p>\n<p>When starting this group, I had no idea if it was going to sustain itself or even do something interesting. After five weeks of a “trial run” in preparation for a full launch next fall, I feel as though the group was as successful as I had hoped and even exceeded some of my early expectations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-structure\"><strong>The Structure</strong></h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6MegldwzQo6IIYge.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>At the start of each week I would create a list of games that center around a specific genre, theme, or idea. Each session would place students into a different kind of play experience, either asking them to play games together in small groups, take turns switching off hot seat style while others observed/directed, or even watching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play_%28video_gaming%29\">lets play videos</a> where we would watch an online personality play through a game for us. For example, in week 4’s discussion <a href=\"https://eglgamestudies.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/game-discussion-series-42315-candybox-a-dark-room-drowning-the-gold-factory-speedwarp/\">“The rebirth of ASCII and how mystery can make games go viral “</a> we discussed and played incremental games such as <a href=\"http://candies.aniwey.net/\">Candybox</a> and <a href=\"http://game.notch.net/drowning/#\">Drowning</a>. Because these are somewhat passive games that require a player to leave them running and return to them at certain moments during the day, we loaded all the games immediately at the start of the session with one persona guiding the mouse, but taking direction from the entire group.</p>\n<p>In addition to the games, I would also pair each collection with an essay from a prominent or important voice in games writing. For week 4 we read <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/191740/Why_Candy_Box_became_more_social_than_social_games.php\">Leigh Alexander’s Essay</a> “Why Candy Box became more social than ‘social games’” which framed our thought process and directed us towards particular questions while playing. This piece was very important to me and I think helped the participants see that this kind of discussion does not happen in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>This also worked towards exposing them to important voices in games, like<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leighalexander\">Leigh Alexander</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/austin_walker\">Austin Walker</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kentsheely.com/\">Kent Sheely</a> whose work informs and articulates this critical investigation.</p>\n<p>Therefore we were not just playing games and talking about them, but framing the discussion by pairing games with a particular theme and supporting that theme with a recent essay by a prominent voice in game criticism.</p>\n<p><strong>What worked?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_IsIWNnjqGXadXMgM.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Starting from a base set of interested participants</em></p>\n<p>Instead of trying to organize this, picking a time to hold it, and advertising, I tried to engage with the students I knew were already interested in this kind of work.

Every Thursday night at the Engagement Lab 10+ students, faculty, and local game enthusiasts would gather in our common space to play and discuss alternative games in a semi-formal setting.\n\nEach week we would play a new indie/art game or collection of games and discuss theme, design (technical and artistic), and rhetoric. Through contemporary and relevant game studies readings that were specifically aligned with the games being played, we explored the games in context of the discourse in which they were created. The games we discussed in this event series typically fly under the normal “gamer” radar and push the boundaries of what digital games are and can be.\n\nI had two main goals in mind when starting this group:\n\n1. Generate a community at Emerson that participates in an ongoing critical engagement with the contemporary indie game discourse.\n\n2. Provide an outlet for Emerson students who are interested not just in playing games together, but talking about games together, in an environment that bridges the gap between a formal class and a free form club.\n\nThere are many meetups and workshops that help connect designers to audiences or designers to other designers, but there are hardly any local groups at Emerson and in the wider Boston community that explores surrounding culture from a critical distance . Ultimately I wanted there to be a place at Emerson for students, faculty, and local game creators/critics/designers to meet in an informal setting to play, talk, and critically engage one another.\n\nWhen starting this group, I had no idea if it was going to sustain itself or even do something interesting. After five weeks of a “trial run” in preparation for a full launch next fall, I feel as though the group was as successful as I had hoped and even exceeded some of my early expectations.\n\n# **The Structure**\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6MegldwzQo6IIYge.png)\n\nAt the start of each week I would create a list of games that center around a specific genre, theme, or idea. Each session would place students into a different kind of play experience, either asking them to play games together in small groups, take turns switching off hot seat style while others observed/directed, or even watching [lets play videos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play_%28video_gaming%29) where we would watch an online personality play through a game for us. For example, in week 4’s discussion [“The rebirth of ASCII and how mystery can make games go viral “](https://eglgamestudies.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/game-discussion-series-42315-candybox-a-dark-room-drowning-the-gold-factory-speedwarp/) we discussed and played incremental games such as [Candybox](http://candies.aniwey.net/) and [Drowning](http://game.notch.net/drowning/#). Because these are somewhat passive games that require a player to leave them running and return to them at certain moments during the day, we loaded all the games immediately at the start of the session with one persona guiding the mouse, but taking direction from the entire group.\n\nIn addition to the games, I would also pair each collection with an essay from a prominent or important voice in games writing. For week 4 we read [Leigh Alexander’s Essay](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/191740/Why_Candy_Box_became_more_social_than_social_games.php) “Why Candy Box became more social than ‘social games’” which framed our thought process and directed us towards particular questions while playing. This piece was very important to me and I think helped the participants see that this kind of discussion does not happen in a vacuum.\n\nThis also worked towards exposing them to important voices in games, like[Leigh Alexander](https://twitter.com/leighalexander) or [Austin Walker](https://twitter.com/austin_walker) or [Kent Sheely](http://www.kentsheely.com/) whose work informs and articulates this critical investigation.\n\nTherefore we were not just playing games and talking about them, but framing the discussion by pairing games with a particular theme and supporting that theme with a recent essay by a prominent voice in game criticism.\n\n**What worked?**\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_IsIWNnjqGXadXMgM.png)\n\n_Starting from a base set of interested participants_\n\nInstead of trying to organize this, picking a time to hold it, and advertising, I tried to engage with the students I knew were already interested in this kind of work. Many of these students came from past classes who displayed interest in game design/criticism or other teacher’s recommendations. In addition, almost 75% of students who attended every week were first and second year students. To find a time that worked best I sent out a doodle survey to gauge which days and times worked best for them and then picked the day with the most availability.\n\n_The free-form, drop in/drop out nature of the group._\n\nI feel we benefited from having isolated discussions that started and concluded each night, rather than having ongoing gameplay sessions over the course of a couple weeks. This helped bring in new students and didn’t make them feel like they missed something or weren’t prepared to engage. Every week had at least one new person, either a friend of a regular participant or someone who heard about the group in passing or by word of mouth.

A group like this thrives on having consistency to establish importance. It was crucial to have a meeting every week no matter what and to keep them at the same day/time. Otherwise students might not have known it was happening and might not have shown up or even bothered to find out.\n\n_Attention to accessibility, representation, and game literacy._\n\nWithin the core group of students who came to all the meetings, there was a wide range of experience levels with gameplay and game thinking.

Then, at the beginning of this year, I started thinking of developing a simulation game that aims to provide a kind of hands-on experience for young entrepreneurs to enable and encourage them to start their own business and initiatives. Based on my previous experience and the simulations I have participated in (not many), I thought to myself, “Yes, maybe I can develop such a game.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_q-0gjmtBArbTae8e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>An opportunity came along the way to submit my idea to the UNDP regional office; this opportunity was opened only for UNDP country offices in the region. My idea was to develop a game with different business scenarios, and to organize the interaction among the group of participants drawn from different stakeholder roles through play. My game was designed to be played in a workshop or a gathering with facilitators, and maybe a trainer. I have never done such a thing but I thought there is a possibility to try.</p>\n<p>Then I participated in the Games for Social Change workshop, which was organized by UNDP Egypt and the regional office in cooperation with the Engagement Lab at Emerson College. The workshop lasted three days. We tested, modified and developed games, and we talked about game design during much of the time. It was an opportunity to meet the team from the Engagement Lab (Mariko Davidson and Sam Liberty), the participants from Egypt, and representatives from other Arab countries. It was great to know that some young people in Egypt have already developed games and started production.</p>\n<p><strong>It was fun, but the question is: what was the added value?</strong></p>\n<p>Looking back to the business model I have developed and the game idea I had in mind, I realized that I have missed some minor issues (you will realize in a few lines that they were not minor at all). Actually, I found that I have accidentally neglected one of the most fundamental elements of developing any game. Sam, our trainer, asked very simple questions: “Is your game FUN to play? Would people play it AGAIN?” Although those questions seem obvious, unfortunately I did not think about it this way at all. The game I had in mind was informative, useful, maybe challenging to a certain degree; but it was not fun, and I am quite sure people will play it only once during a workshop. This question made me rethink the whole game.</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>Sam, our trainer, asked very simple questions: “Is your game FUN to play? Would people play it AGAIN?”</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_60WYVkMdR8X4-boU.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>During the workshop I worked with a small group to develop a game that aims to provide information and guidance about crowd funding. With the guidance from our trainer, and the great ideas from our team — we did it. We developed a prototype of a fun, playable, and useful game. This achievement changed my mindset from “maybe I can do it” to “YES I will do it.”</p>\n<p>Besides all the cool things I have learned from this workshop about game design and modification, another issue stood out. The idea of using gamification for social change. I am still wondering and searching about this topic, which will definitely add great value to my ongoing and future work.</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>We developed a prototype of a fun, playable, and useful game. This achievement changed my mindset from “*maybe I can do it”</em> to “<em>YES I will do it</em>.”*</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <strong>Steps Forward</strong></p>\n<p>Coming back to Iraq and my office in UNDP, I started talking to people to sell the idea of games and gamification. I found huge interest. Therefore, in the coming few weeks I will organize a session for UN staff and project managers and another workshop for young activists. Also, I am revisiting my previous plan to develop my game — to make it more fun and appealing and to gather a team to help in the process. As I work on this, I remind myself that developing a game is a process that will have better outcome if it is done in a participatory manner. At the same time, I will keep following up with my small team from Egypt for further testing and modification of our crowd funding game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_-guE4MKStptLdmKe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the main findings of my preliminary research is that Iraq does not have organizations, groups, or companies working on developing games. Therefore, this topic is new and I hope my work will help many people realize that they can create their own games. I am sure we used to make silly games when we were kids.

Then, at the beginning of this year, I started thinking of developing a simulation game that aims to provide a kind of hands-on experience for young entrepreneurs to enable and encourage them to start their own business and initiatives. Based on my previous experience and the simulations I have participated in (not many), I thought to myself, “Yes, maybe I can develop such a game.”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_q-0gjmtBArbTae8e.jpg)\n\nAn opportunity came along the way to submit my idea to the UNDP regional office; this opportunity was opened only for UNDP country offices in the region. My idea was to develop a game with different business scenarios, and to organize the interaction among the group of participants drawn from different stakeholder roles through play. My game was designed to be played in a workshop or a gathering with facilitators, and maybe a trainer. I have never done such a thing but I thought there is a possibility to try.\n\nThen I participated in the Games for Social Change workshop, which was organized by UNDP Egypt and the regional office in cooperation with the Engagement Lab at Emerson College. The workshop lasted three days. We tested, modified and developed games, and we talked about game design during much of the time. It was an opportunity to meet the team from the Engagement Lab (Mariko Davidson and Sam Liberty), the participants from Egypt, and representatives from other Arab countries. It was great to know that some young people in Egypt have already developed games and started production.\n\n**It was fun, but the question is: what was the added value?**\n\nLooking back to the business model I have developed and the game idea I had in mind, I realized that I have missed some minor issues (you will realize in a few lines that they were not minor at all). Actually, I found that I have accidentally neglected one of the most fundamental elements of developing any game. Sam, our trainer, asked very simple questions: “Is your game FUN to play? Would people play it AGAIN?” Although those questions seem obvious, unfortunately I did not think about it this way at all. The game I had in mind was informative, useful, maybe challenging to a certain degree; but it was not fun, and I am quite sure people will play it only once during a workshop. This question made me rethink the whole game.\n\n&gt; _Sam, our trainer, asked very simple questions: “Is your game FUN to play? Would people play it AGAIN?”_\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_60WYVkMdR8X4-boU.jpg)\n\nDuring the workshop I worked with a small group to develop a game that aims to provide information and guidance about crowd funding. With the guidance from our trainer, and the great ideas from our team — we did it. We developed a prototype of a fun, playable, and useful game. This achievement changed my mindset from “maybe I can do it” to “YES I will do it.”\n\nBesides all the cool things I have learned from this workshop about game design and modification, another issue stood out. The idea of using gamification for social change. I am still wondering and searching about this topic, which will definitely add great value to my ongoing and future work.\n\n&gt; *We developed a prototype of a fun, playable, and useful game. This achievement changed my mindset from “*maybe I can do it”* to “*YES I will do it*.”*\n\n&gt; &gt; **Steps Forward**\n\nComing back to Iraq and my office in UNDP, I started talking to people to sell the idea of games and gamification. I found huge interest. Therefore, in the coming few weeks I will organize a session for UN staff and project managers and another workshop for young activists. Also, I am revisiting my previous plan to develop my game — to make it more fun and appealing and to gather a team to help in the process. As I work on this, I remind myself that developing a game is a process that will have better outcome if it is done in a participatory manner. At the same time, I will keep following up with my small team from Egypt for further testing and modification of our crowd funding game.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_-guE4MKStptLdmKe.jpg)\n\nOne of the main findings of my preliminary research is that Iraq does not have organizations, groups, or companies working on developing games. Therefore, this topic is new and I hope my work will help many people realize that they can create their own games. I am sure we used to make silly games when we were kids. I am planning to take people back to that age when they used to be creative and fearless of failing and trying again. The magic recipe would be the combination of Design Thinking as the guiding methodology and tools to be applied in designing games and gamification for social change.\n\n**\\*Dhafer Hasan** is a program analyst for UNDP in Baghdad, Iraq.

This was our first event of this kind, so we also wanted to learn about the needs and interests of the audience to plan for future events. From the 25 attendees, we learned there is a strong desire in the student body to grow game development skills through workshops about things like the <a href=\"https://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform\">Unity</a> platform and game writing. We also learned that both groups enthusiastically support relationship building between women leaders in the game industry and students.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Qn1EVwMlf73Of94-.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The day began with introductions and a Grow-a-Game activity. Students shared their passions for animation, graphic design, computer science, and media studies as well as their favorite games of the moment. To open the program, Engagement Lab Project Manager Christina Wilson unpacked the science of play through a crash course on game systems, which include the magic circle, game mechanics, objectives, obstacles, and constructed values. After analyzing the actions, rules, and themes of Pac-Man, we talked through what an adaption of the game to address gentrification might look like.

This was our first event of this kind, so we also wanted to learn about the needs and interests of the audience to plan for future events. From the 25 attendees, we learned there is a strong desire in the student body to grow game development skills through workshops about things like the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform) platform and game writing. We also learned that both groups enthusiastically support relationship building between women leaders in the game industry and students.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Qn1EVwMlf73Of94-.png)\n\nThe day began with introductions and a Grow-a-Game activity. Students shared their passions for animation, graphic design, computer science, and media studies as well as their favorite games of the moment. To open the program, Engagement Lab Project Manager Christina Wilson unpacked the science of play through a crash course on game systems, which include the magic circle, game mechanics, objectives, obstacles, and constructed values. After analyzing the actions, rules, and themes of Pac-Man, we talked through what an adaption of the game to address gentrification might look like. Participants rapidly brainstormed ideas, such as the Pac-Man ghosts representing the covered-over history of a neighborhood’s past or the cherry icons representing national franchises like, Starbucks or Whole Foods, moving into neighborhoods.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Yc-cfpVWDhmhjPn9.png)\n\nThen we broke out into small groups to play [Grow a Game](http://www.tiltfactor.org/game/grow-a-game/) (available on the App Store) to practice designing mechanics, objectives, and themes.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_qSSAwopi5eXAo-EQ.jpg)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_hQczR9LDB0aN8Y-Q.jpg)\n\nWith the rapid rounds, players had 3 minutes to combine various verbs, atmospheres, and challenges to produce game concepts.

Movies, games, and even column writers provide their audiences with stories that aren’t true to their origin. Case in point: <em>Stonewall</em>, and its whitewashing; Ridley Scott’s movies, and his Caucasian Egyptians; the assassins in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, and their supposedly altruistic nature.<a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/#_edn1\">[i]</a> So rather than continue with the inaccuracies and promotions of stereotypical characters, Ms. Meta’s creator Sarah Zaidan wishes to obliterate all of that.</p>\n<p>“The Adventures of Ms. Meta” will be a female superhero game that is an experience; fueled by the need to live through a time period, rather than just get to the goals. A game designed to help you learn. Imagine being able to live through a time period, not only as a character, but as a personality that resonates with the player. Inhabit her role, play along the time, wear their clothes, and debunk the common myths surrounding people then.</p>\n<p>The title comes from both metamorphosis and meta-textual, “and meta as in breaking the 4th wall,” Zaidan said. The game contains POC characters, historically accurate stories, and the opportunity to be able to create — and play — as your own character. “You can create your character to be a person of color,” Zaidan said. There will be dialog options, circumstances that are dependent on your character’s ethnicity, and scenarios true to their history.</p>\n<p>Sarah Zaidan — an illustrator, a game designer, and a fellow at Engagement Lab — knows that background information matters a lot here. “I am committed,” she said, “I am collecting resources on this as we speak.” The characters will have many facets, and not just one skin color. They will interact with side characters from behind the scenes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Accuracy:</em></strong></p>\n<p>To maintain the correctness, Zaidan plans on beta testing the game with people of color; something she also did for the collaborative superhero comic she is a part of (My So-Called Secret Identity). Ms. Meta will abstain from having stereotypical characters, their stories will not be “…a white person’s interpretations of what this POC’s background or experiences are like.” Zaidan wants to involve people who’ve had the experiences required to create this game. “It’s not to say that I believe that you can’t tell an authentic story about someone who doesn’t have your experiences,” she said, “but it helps to be able to allow those voices to tell their stories without the filter of being used as a research resource by someone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Design:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Zaidan is working out the mechanics and making prototypes. “My character creation system right now looks like paper dolls,” she said, “but it gets the job done.” Currently, Zaidan is working on making the visuals, “I’m grateful that my original training is as an artist,” she said. She will also design the UI and the UX. Each decade represented will reflect the design of comics from that time. Zaidan’s experience as a professor of games classes comes handy — by going through the teaching process of mechanics and gameplay, her own teachings get reinforced. She remembers “how to balance the game, how to avoid the game only being fun to win but not fun to play.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Action</em>:</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, <em>Ms. Meta</em> has funding for the first decade. The prologue, which will be set in the present day, will have a tutorial level to get the player familiar with the game’s mechanics. Zaidan wants to give the players of this game an experience similar to that of <em>Arkham Knight</em>. The players will be able to create the female superhero that they desire, “but perhaps not through as many different modes of gameplay.” By not being restricted in options for characters, the game will allow the player to have a vivid experience. “And like <em>Valiant Hearts</em>,” Zaidan said, “it aims to make you care about the NPCs (non-player characters).”</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Future:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Zaidan knows that every player has a different reason to play the game. The aesthetic, the game type, the puzzle, or even the concept. Here, the concept is superheroes. “Superheroes are everywhere,” she said. While 2015 saw the release of Batman: Arkham Knight, and Deadpool (scheduled for re-release on PS4 and Xbox One in November),<a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/#_edn2\">[ii]</a> the next two years will have at least 15 superhero movies.

Movies, games, and even column writers provide their audiences with stories that aren’t true to their origin. Case in point: _Stonewall_, and its whitewashing; Ridley Scott’s movies, and his Caucasian Egyptians; the assassins in _Assassin’s Creed_, and their supposedly altruistic nature.[[i]](http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/#_edn1) So rather than continue with the inaccuracies and promotions of stereotypical characters, Ms. Meta’s creator Sarah Zaidan wishes to obliterate all of that.\n\n“The Adventures of Ms. Meta” will be a female superhero game that is an experience; fueled by the need to live through a time period, rather than just get to the goals. A game designed to help you learn. Imagine being able to live through a time period, not only as a character, but as a personality that resonates with the player. Inhabit her role, play along the time, wear their clothes, and debunk the common myths surrounding people then.\n\nThe title comes from both metamorphosis and meta-textual, “and meta as in breaking the 4th wall,” Zaidan said. The game contains POC characters, historically accurate stories, and the opportunity to be able to create — and play — as your own character. “You can create your character to be a person of color,” Zaidan said. There will be dialog options, circumstances that are dependent on your character’s ethnicity, and scenarios true to their history.\n\nSarah Zaidan — an illustrator, a game designer, and a fellow at Engagement Lab — knows that background information matters a lot here. “I am committed,” she said, “I am collecting resources on this as we speak.” The characters will have many facets, and not just one skin color. They will interact with side characters from behind the scenes.\n\n**_The Accuracy:_**\n\nTo maintain the correctness, Zaidan plans on beta testing the game with people of color; something she also did for the collaborative superhero comic she is a part of (My So-Called Secret Identity). Ms. Meta will abstain from having stereotypical characters, their stories will not be “…a white person’s interpretations of what this POC’s background or experiences are like.” Zaidan wants to involve people who’ve had the experiences required to create this game. “It’s not to say that I believe that you can’t tell an authentic story about someone who doesn’t have your experiences,” she said, “but it helps to be able to allow those voices to tell their stories without the filter of being used as a research resource by someone.\n\n**_The Design:_**\n\nZaidan is working out the mechanics and making prototypes. “My character creation system right now looks like paper dolls,” she said, “but it gets the job done.” Currently, Zaidan is working on making the visuals, “I’m grateful that my original training is as an artist,” she said. She will also design the UI and the UX. Each decade represented will reflect the design of comics from that time. Zaidan’s experience as a professor of games classes comes handy — by going through the teaching process of mechanics and gameplay, her own teachings get reinforced. She remembers “how to balance the game, how to avoid the game only being fun to win but not fun to play.”\n\n**_The Action_:**\n\nCurrently, _Ms. Meta_ has funding for the first decade. The prologue, which will be set in the present day, will have a tutorial level to get the player familiar with the game’s mechanics. Zaidan wants to give the players of this game an experience similar to that of _Arkham Knight_. The players will be able to create the female superhero that they desire, “but perhaps not through as many different modes of gameplay.” By not being restricted in options for characters, the game will allow the player to have a vivid experience. “And like _Valiant Hearts_,” Zaidan said, “it aims to make you care about the NPCs (non-player characters).”\n\n**_The Future:_**\n\nZaidan knows that every player has a different reason to play the game. The aesthetic, the game type, the puzzle, or even the concept. Here, the concept is superheroes. “Superheroes are everywhere,” she said. While 2015 saw the release of Batman: Arkham Knight, and Deadpool (scheduled for re-release on PS4 and Xbox One in November),[[ii]](http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/#_edn2) the next two years will have at least 15 superhero movies.

I think what was most impressive, and most gratifying as an instructor, was seeing novice designers make the cognitive leaps necessary to think like game design experts and embrace the aspects of play that make it such a powerful tool for engagement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_AFoBRHyxor3x37u_.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"next-level-thinking\">Next-Level Thinking</h1>\n<p>When people think about the genre of games commonly called “serious games,” they tend to make some counterproductive assumptions. This is natural, and one of the tasks that evangelists like us need to fulfill is dispelling misconceptions. It’s the first step down the road to good game design. The first of these is misidentifying the “why” of games. Why use them? What are they actually good at doing?</p>\n<p>One common attitude is that games should be used to stealthily teach content to kids, tricking them into learning information that we want them to know, but is “boring.” Many believe that just sugar-coating normal educational content through play will make it more palatable to children. This is sometimes referred to as “<strong>chocolate-covered broccoli.</strong>” There is some evidence that supports the notion that kids learn better when they are allowed to play, but it’s less clear that the reason is motivation to learn. Framing traditional learning content with badly designed games “for the sake of fun” is one of the tactics that give educational games the slightly cynical tinge that can surround it. Unfortunately, this design philosophy is still a common one, and completely misses the true power of play to engage.</p>\n<p>In order to reframe the way we think about games and correctly identify how and when to use them as a tool, a number of cognitive leaps are needed. Here are some of the most important ones that I saw being made at the workshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_bdMNvOzA2j7s-YhK.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"1-games-need-to-be-fun-in-their-own-right\">1. Games need to be fun in their own right</h1>\n<p>This might seem obvious, but a lot of novice designers (especially when they design for social impact) can take fun for granted. Fun is something that happens when you play games, right? So why worry about that? Just make sure your learning objectives are covered, and let the players do the rest. This is a toxic attitude, and one I was happy to see disappear the more the designers at the workshop learned and playtested.</p>\n<p>If a game is not fun in its own right, why would anyone engage with it? They could go through the motions, sure. But they’ll be thinking about other things, and may even resent the process instead of enjoying it. Just as important is whether the game will ever be played again after the onboarding process ends. Many games for social impact are optimistically designed to go “viral.” This is an admirable goal, but one that is exceedingly rare in “serious” games, and impossible for a game that is not exceptionally fun.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2-games-are-best-at-representing-systems\">2. Games are best at representing systems</h1>\n<p>This goes back to the question of why to use games in the first place. A lecture or non-game exercise teaches in a much more straightforward way. Other forms of art such as video or comic strips can pack a lot more information into a much shorter time. Games are by their nature inefficient. Play gets in the way, after all. So why use them? The answer is that games, more than any other expression of thought, are good at demonstrating how a system works, because a game is a system of rules, obstacles, and actions.</p>\n<p>I had the designers at the workshop attack their games from this angle, and even had them explicitly define the systems they were modeling. Even then I saw many games that simply framed trivia-like content in a playful way. However, once the mental leap was made and the workshoppers began to think about their social issue as a playable problem, the quality of their games improved drastically. They became both more fun and more effective tools at once.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3-games-must-be-challenging\">3. Games must be challenging</h1>\n<p>This is a little trickier, and making sure your game has the right level of challenge is one of the most difficult tasks game designers face. Make your game too easy and it won’t present a challenge. People will get bored, and not engage with it. Make it too difficult or too complex, and you scare away your audience (who will often be lacking game literacy skills, since this work is being done in the development context).</p>\n<p>Novice designers often include “challenges” in their games that are “for fun.” For instance, when you draw a red card, everyone has to run to the other side of the room. Running, jumping, or acting might be fun, but these challenges are irrelevant to the larger context, don’t support the central mechanic of the game, and often don’t even carry a risk of failure. Without a risk for failure, or at least consequences, a game action is meaningless.</p>\n<p>In one instance, the early iteration of a cooperative game had no risk of failure whatsoever. The mechanics were fun, but there was no sense of urgency in any of the game’s actions, so it failed to engage. The next iteration added a two-strike mechanism where if you ever failed twice, the game ended in a loss for everybody. This made the game incredibly tense, and much more fun. It also put a greater strain on the table’s ability to work as a team and manage resources.</p>\n<p>Games are a perfect way to let players experiment and fail safely, so do not be afraid to let them fail. The more the designers at the workshop put challenging mechanisms in their games and attached meaningful consequences to them, the better their games became.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4-the-power-of-narrative\">4. The power of narrative</h1>\n<p>All games tell stories, though some are more abstract than others. The best designed games have their mechanics fully integrated into the game’s narrative. This means that the rules system feels natural in the context of the real-life system it’s modeling. When players execute an action in the game, they feel like they are executing its real-life counterpart. When the mechanics are completely integrated into the narrative, the story actually helps you remember the rules. They match up and reinforce one another.</p>\n<p>When working in the development context or designing a game for social change, the interplay between mechanics and narrative are even more important. The last thing you want is to put a perverse incentive into your game (rewarding players for taking actions that would be destructive in the real-world context), or to encode misinformation about the real world into your game system.</p>\n<p>When form does not match function, there are two ways to approach the problem. The first is to chop away actions that don’t seem to support the narrative. Removing or altering mechanics that are counter-intuitive seems obvious, but it is not a natural instinct. It must be learned. The second approach is to alter the story, or create in-world reasonings that explain quirks of the game system. Typically, a combination of these two tactics are needed to make a game and its narrative feel integrated. Not all the games that came out of the workshop had a strong narrative component, but the more the designers considered the alignment of story and mechanics, the better their games became.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_9Heiwb-an0MZtc3P.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"building-confidence\">Building Confidence</h1>\n<p>Another outcome of the workshop was building confidence. Before the workshop, almost every attendee said they knew very little about games, and even less about designing them. They were interested in the power of games to achieve real-world goals, but were not confident in their own skills to make it happen. By the end of the workshop, they reported gaining skills and knowledge. A vast majority of attendees said they were now confident that they could design and implement a game, and that their game could have real world impact.</p>\n<p>What explains this huge boost in confidence? I believe it’s because of the insistence of the workshop itself that every member not just experiment with game design, but actually create a playable game. Although the stakes of the workshop were low, the tone and pace of the workshop put tremendous pressure on the groups to achieve something playable for the showcase at the end of Day 3. Different groups handled this pressure in different ways, but all achieved a playable game prototype. More than that, they were all <em>good</em>, and the level of polish and completeness that the best games showed surprised even me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_1vkjprUTJCZHmWxn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"training-of-the-trainers-and-the-future-of-games4dev\">Training of the Trainers and the Future of Games4Dev</h1>\n<p>So what does the future hold for these groups and their creations? UNDP Egypt has agreed to support all of the designers as they work toward iterating upon and polishing their prototypes. I’m confident that many of them will make the leap from concept to implementation.</p>\n<p>Even more exciting is the Training of the Trainers (TOT) program that took place on the workshop’s fourth day. A group of select participants, all exhausted from three days of intensive design work, gathered at the UNDP office in Cairo for one more day of work. This time, instead of designing games, they were designing their own workshops that build on the ideas they learned over the past week.</p>\n<p>The hope is that these TOT participants will make the workshop their own and spread its ideas throughout the region — not just to people who are in or able to travel to Cairo. Participants from other parts of Egypt as well as Yemen, Sudan, Morocco, and Iraq attended the TOT session and expressed an interest in continuing these efforts back home.</p>\n<p>I am hopeful that this will happen and that there is a promising future ahead for Games for Development. It was a great pleasure and honor to work with everyone who attended, especially the representatives from UNDP, who performed tremendous feats to make sure the workshop went off without a hitch.

As the process becomes finalized in the coming months, expect to see more updates on this initiative.\n\n_Sam Liberty is Senior Game Designer at the Engagement Lab._\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2015-12-08T05:00:00Z"},"key":"in-cairo-engaged-citizens-design-games","__v":0}

How local government meaningfully engages its constituents, especially more vulnerable and hard to reach populations, is (or should be) a central concern of every department — from the mayor’s office, to public works and planning. The second cohort of the <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/cityaccelerator\">City Accelerator</a>, which is an eighteen-month program composed of five cities throughout the United States, is focused on just this concern. Over the course of the program, participating cities will experiment with new and promising approaches to better engage their low-income residents, and also work to embed better engagement practices into their ongoing operations. Included in the cohort are Albuquerque, Atlanta, Baltimore, New Orleans and Seattle, each of which has identified a policy or process problem around which public engagement can be improved.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0__VYFqXkuh_E8CF8Y.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>Albuquerque is focused on engaging immigrant entrepreneurs.</strong> With a population that is majority minority, and an increasing amount of immigrants eager to enter the workforce, Albuquerque represents the conditions of every American city in the near future. In an effort to assure full participation in the economy, the mayor’s office has been eager to hear from small business owners through what they have called “small business deep dives.” These intimate conversations with the mayor and his staff have been fruitful in uncovering issues and adding complexity and texture to known issues. Through the<a href=\"http://www.governing.com/cityaccelerator\"> City Accelerator</a> program, the city will continue its deep dive practice, but with a renewed focus specifically on immigrant entrepreneurs.

The Westside has historical significance as one of Atlanta’s and the country’s oldest black neighborhoods with a direct connection to the civil rights movement. It is currently experiencing extreme poverty and blight, where development is likely to have disruptive, not transformative impacts on the lives of its current occupants. The goal of the <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/cityaccelerator\">City Accelerator</a> project is to bring the voices of these underrepresented populations into the conversation about how community benefits sparked by development will be distributed to the local communities.

This project focuses on the communication gap between government and non-governmental supports and people who can directly benefit from them. The moment people leave prison, there is need to communicate options for positive social alternatives and basic supports in such a way that enables independent decision-making and appropriate structure. The <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/cityaccelerator\">City Accelerator</a> project will focus on understanding what communication channels exist, how they currently function, and how they can function better.

For those who may not know, Stephen has been an instrumental part of the Lab from the very beginning (back when there was still “game” in our title). Simply put, the Lab would not be the same without his tireless dedication, unique vision and sense of humor. We’re excited for his next chapter, but sad to see him go. The good news? He’s not going too far as he’ll still be involved as a member of the Lab’s advisory board.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_x9bwkPehnjZ1G6Bu.jpg)\n\nTaking over the role of Managing Director, we’re thrilled to welcome the amazing**Mariko Davidson**.

Things that are needed for making a difference in user data online. Jose Luis Agundez (AT&amp;T), the moderator, introduces the panel by saying that we need to connect research, policy, end users and data more clearly. We have an opportunity to shed light on the status of tools and data. He notes that we need a reality check. We can choose to not care and we can also choose to take specific steps in the right direction in terms of privacy of user data. What is the force of the users and the people? What is the potential way forward? He notes that transparency of government data is different from transparency of personal data and we should not conflate the two. This session is focused on data transparency in relation to personal, user data.</p>\n<p><strong>Scott Meyer (CEO, Ghostery)</strong></p>\n<p>He polls the audience to see how many work in marketing &amp; advertising. About 3 people. He says this is a problem in terms of having this conversation. Shows a terrifying graphic of the marketing tech landscape. Marketing technology is creating a cluttered and expensive collection of point solutions. It’s growing tremendously. It presents new problems. Ghostery is neutral — provide tools to have better digital experience. All the marketing tech makes the digital experience slow and sucky for end users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_U6YC7Ncv0kuI0NqY.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just in the past 6 months and given the growth of mobile — consumers are now mad because they have a slow web experience.

Ghostery provides better transparency so businesses and users can make better decisions. You can install on your browser for free. Ghostery is a business and they make money by consumers opting into anonymous data — retail, banks, travel, etc. The company that owns the webpage doesn’t understand the tracking ecosystem either. How do you make money? You appeal to marketers’ greed and fear. The problems right now in this landscape are performance, governance , security and privacy.

Today he is speaking as himself. He is here because he believes in transparency and privacy. Digital Advertising industry has a huge lack of credibility and trust. They have a problem with Ad Fraud (robots clicking things) and Ad Blocking (apps that block them). He calls this a User-Media Owner crisis. Now the advertiser is also intervening in this relationship. At some point Ad Tech has been growing and has somehow broken this relationship, necessitating the user of ad blockers.</p>\n<p>The perceived benefits of ad block are better user experience, faster page loading, improved privacy. How do you fix this? We need to re-establish the dialogue with the user. His paper is behind a paywall. The users believe in quality content and that’s why they visit the paper’s site. 12 years ago they were talking about best practices like having sound off by default and other conveniences for user. They have forgotten all of this. He says advertising needs to also rediscover their creativity. They have moved their energy from creativity in communicating with the user and towards quantifying. They also need to improve media owners’ knowledge of this landscape. A huge problem with the growth of ad tech is that so many companies have sprung up. They come to us and promise to increase revenue by just placing their tags on your web pages. The knowledge of the publisher is not keeping up to speed with the industry and they are adding a lot of “rubbish” to their pages. Web without advertising would be a subscription based web. We need to work to improve knowledge in the industry to create user-centric solutions but also remember that ads are what allow for content to be “free”.</p>\n<p><strong>Mat Travizano (GranData)</strong></p>\n<p>Company specializes in social analytics and social good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_t3kzaI632ol8Wzz4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>His company does cross-industry data monetization.

He founded a research lab to make data more useful and accessible. Design is a human-centric discipline. So this means that the user’s experience should be at the center of our thinking.

How can we make it easier for people to live within these data systems?</p>\n<p>They built a visualization called Behind the Banner about mobile data visualization. He teaches at ITP.

The idea here is about producing collective action. There are two problems with our conversation — it’s all people like us. Not people who are most affected by these things. Discrimination affects the unempowered and underprivileged. How do we bring more people to the table? Building Floodwatch they can try to empower these groups.

Is it really a tradeoff between free content and ads?</p>\n<p><strong>Alessandro:</strong> We need to go back to best practices in ads but also think about more user-centric perspective on ads. Advertisers are using third party data — good at aggregate level but not at individual level. There are studies that show that it’s better to actually just show random ads than do targeting. 90% of industry will use third party data that tells you user’s income to target them. They are profiling users for luxury travel, golf, yachts. Inferring things. If this is done with knowledge of user and respect to the user then good digital advertising. But we are talking about data as if there was one type of it.

Despite different topic areas within the city projects, the cohort is utilizing similar approaches such as: upgrading existing engagement structures, assuring inclusivity, and refining storytelling methods to address improving engagement. Today’s commonplace engagement practices, such as traditional town hall meetings often face similar challenges of reaching a diversity of stakeholders, engaging different age groups, and maintaining short feedback loops of communication. The rapidly evolving technology of the private sector and it’s priorities of customer satisfaction, agile development that constantly produces new updates, and integrating services into already utilized ones creates new pressures and expectations for the public sector. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, trust in government is historically low. While newer programs like Code for America and the digital consultancies such as <a href=\"https://18f.gsa.gov/\">18F</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service\">U.S. Digital Services</a> primarily work toward improving the technological back-end of government, there are institutions that have refined the best practices of engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Accelerating the Culture of Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>Programs like the City Accelerator, create space to unpack the barriers to engagement and try new approaches. Some of the themes that have emerged from the cohort have explored how to tailor and appropriately use technology and strategies for trust-building with historically underrepresented communities. Most of the cities brush up against a central issue of engagement. What are the best ways of strengthening the back-end tools to effectively archive community conversations, record and analyze community input, and communicate the findings and further decision-making in a timely manner? As the cohort is almost halfway into their timeline, they will continue diving deeper into these questions. In the meantime, a summary of the convening in Baltimore is below.</p>\n<p><strong>The Baltimore Convening</strong></p>\n<p>The crisp Autumn day began with rapid-fire presentations from the cities about Phase I of their projects. The teams in Albuquerque and Seattle are working with similar themes of consolidating available resources and improving feedback loops. The Albuquerque team is working on integrating systems that help immigrant entrepreneurs navigate the business development ecosystem. Frank Mirabal, the project city lead from Albuquerque reminded us of the power of communicating existing resources with the sobering lesson that, “To see is to be seen”. Seattle faces similar concerns of consolidating useful information and strengthening the related communication loops. In lieu of improving how Seattle conducts community engagement, they are identifying overlapping outreach efforts and centralizing communication to avoid fatiguing communities for input. Kathy Nyland, Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, reminded us that “Just because an issue is new to us, doesn’t mean it’s new to a resident.” Thus the Seattle team is exploring ways to better archive previous community conversations prior to revisiting certain conversations such as housing developments in a specific neighborhood that may have already discussed this topic before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_MfIc5q1Wz6WoP3KD.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Seattle’s Engagement Process imagined in Visio</em></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the teams from New Orleans and Atlanta shared the outcomes of their efforts to employ public design and co-design approaches. The team in New Orleans has worked on moving beyond generic focus groups by engaging group participants and relevant stakeholders in a culminating design workshop to source solutions to design for increasing primary health care use. The participatory framework is meant to encourage creativity, collaboration, and buy-in among people who are not seeking primary care. Similarly, Atlanta’s project is based on a public design framework which gathers feedback for a storytelling project and allows participants to define the ways they want to be communicated with. The public design approach uses design-thinking when co-creating the story collection and sharing campaign to establish relationships in neighborhoods. This process of mutual story-sharing aims to build trust between underrepresented voices that are soon to receive community benefit distributions and the influencers and decision-makers leading the projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_sG5lySHEn2BOTEL2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Atlanta’s public design project relies on design-thinking</em></p>\n<p><strong>Accelerator! To Engagement, and Beyond!</strong></p>\n<p>Next, convening participants playtested a game called about balancing the needs for transparency, creativity, and inclusivity while planning community engagement initiatives. The game is meant to be played in the early stages of a project to help teams explore strategies, role play possible outcomes, and understand the implications of their actions. Participants hedged their bets for which elements of strategic planning to invest in and then role-played “voices from the community” who may have been pleased or upset about what the teams ended up investing in. The game was designed as a potential supplement to a guide on community engagement implementation strategies after finding a dearth of such resources available.* In the debrief, participants shared a range of reactions: from laughter to frustrations. Some insights gleaned included the opportunity to consider previously overlooked stakeholders that arose during the role-playing process.</p>\n<p><strong>Inside the Public Servant’s Studio</strong></p>\n<p>After a delicious lunch break and an introduction to phase II project planning, there were in-depth conversations and mini panels on three central themes that have emerged from the cohort thus far. The conversations delved into intersections between community engagement and design-thinking, internal municipal communications infrastructure, and trust-building. Gleaned insights included nuances such as the difference between outreach and information: where one is about conveying information while engagement is more of a conversation. Improving the back-end coordination is helping cities like Seattle set forth higher expectations about having constructive conversations between cities and citizens. Similarly, the New Orleans team is finding that a more interactive approach through co-design is helping facilitate conversations with people, rather a merely one-way communications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_VQUP0Ije2cCoADYq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Inside the Public Servant’s Studio: In-depth conversations of emerging themes within the City Accelerator Cohort</em></p>\n<p>In discussing trust-building, the Atlanta team reiterated the importance of working with people who have well-established relationships in communities. Building trust is a long-term process, but it can help cities be more proactive rather than reactive in how they interact with their constituents. While building trust is a priority, Atlanta’s academic lead Chris LeDantec explained that a lack of trust can be productive at times since that tension can motivate progress. The participants had more of a chance to reflect on the themes of design-thinking, internal municipal communications infrastructure, and trust-building through plotting out in a creative matrix how they might address different stakeholders needs through these lenses.</p>\n<p>Following a full day of unpacking city engagement practices and lessons, the cohort joined a panel on <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/community-engagement-through-the-lens-of-criminal-justice-reform-tickets-19016452722\">Community Engagement through the Lens of Criminal Justice Reform</a>. The backgrounds of the powerful speakers ranged from nonprofits to governmental agencies. They spoke about new trauma-informed care approaches in their work and ways of activating community members to help with the reentry process.

Despite different topic areas within the city projects, the cohort is utilizing similar approaches such as: upgrading existing engagement structures, assuring inclusivity, and refining storytelling methods to address improving engagement. Today’s commonplace engagement practices, such as traditional town hall meetings often face similar challenges of reaching a diversity of stakeholders, engaging different age groups, and maintaining short feedback loops of communication. The rapidly evolving technology of the private sector and it’s priorities of customer satisfaction, agile development that constantly produces new updates, and integrating services into already utilized ones creates new pressures and expectations for the public sector. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, trust in government is historically low. While newer programs like Code for America and the digital consultancies such as [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and the [U.S. Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) primarily work toward improving the technological back-end of government, there are institutions that have refined the best practices of engagement.\n\n**Accelerating the Culture of Engagement**\n\nPrograms like the City Accelerator, create space to unpack the barriers to engagement and try new approaches. Some of the themes that have emerged from the cohort have explored how to tailor and appropriately use technology and strategies for trust-building with historically underrepresented communities. Most of the cities brush up against a central issue of engagement. What are the best ways of strengthening the back-end tools to effectively archive community conversations, record and analyze community input, and communicate the findings and further decision-making in a timely manner? As the cohort is almost halfway into their timeline, they will continue diving deeper into these questions. In the meantime, a summary of the convening in Baltimore is below.\n\n**The Baltimore Convening**\n\nThe crisp Autumn day began with rapid-fire presentations from the cities about Phase I of their projects. The teams in Albuquerque and Seattle are working with similar themes of consolidating available resources and improving feedback loops. The Albuquerque team is working on integrating systems that help immigrant entrepreneurs navigate the business development ecosystem. Frank Mirabal, the project city lead from Albuquerque reminded us of the power of communicating existing resources with the sobering lesson that, “To see is to be seen”. Seattle faces similar concerns of consolidating useful information and strengthening the related communication loops. In lieu of improving how Seattle conducts community engagement, they are identifying overlapping outreach efforts and centralizing communication to avoid fatiguing communities for input. Kathy Nyland, Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, reminded us that “Just because an issue is new to us, doesn’t mean it’s new to a resident.” Thus the Seattle team is exploring ways to better archive previous community conversations prior to revisiting certain conversations such as housing developments in a specific neighborhood that may have already discussed this topic before.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_MfIc5q1Wz6WoP3KD.png)\n\n_Seattle’s Engagement Process imagined in Visio_\n\nMeanwhile, the teams from New Orleans and Atlanta shared the outcomes of their efforts to employ public design and co-design approaches. The team in New Orleans has worked on moving beyond generic focus groups by engaging group participants and relevant stakeholders in a culminating design workshop to source solutions to design for increasing primary health care use. The participatory framework is meant to encourage creativity, collaboration, and buy-in among people who are not seeking primary care. Similarly, Atlanta’s project is based on a public design framework which gathers feedback for a storytelling project and allows participants to define the ways they want to be communicated with. The public design approach uses design-thinking when co-creating the story collection and sharing campaign to establish relationships in neighborhoods. This process of mutual story-sharing aims to build trust between underrepresented voices that are soon to receive community benefit distributions and the influencers and decision-makers leading the projects.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_sG5lySHEn2BOTEL2.png)\n\n_Atlanta’s public design project relies on design-thinking_\n\n**Accelerator! To Engagement, and Beyond!**\n\nNext, convening participants playtested a game called about balancing the needs for transparency, creativity, and inclusivity while planning community engagement initiatives. The game is meant to be played in the early stages of a project to help teams explore strategies, role play possible outcomes, and understand the implications of their actions. Participants hedged their bets for which elements of strategic planning to invest in and then role-played “voices from the community” who may have been pleased or upset about what the teams ended up investing in. The game was designed as a potential supplement to a guide on community engagement implementation strategies after finding a dearth of such resources available.\\* In the debrief, participants shared a range of reactions: from laughter to frustrations. Some insights gleaned included the opportunity to consider previously overlooked stakeholders that arose during the role-playing process.\n\n**Inside the Public Servant’s Studio**\n\nAfter a delicious lunch break and an introduction to phase II project planning, there were in-depth conversations and mini panels on three central themes that have emerged from the cohort thus far. The conversations delved into intersections between community engagement and design-thinking, internal municipal communications infrastructure, and trust-building. Gleaned insights included nuances such as the difference between outreach and information: where one is about conveying information while engagement is more of a conversation. Improving the back-end coordination is helping cities like Seattle set forth higher expectations about having constructive conversations between cities and citizens. Similarly, the New Orleans team is finding that a more interactive approach through co-design is helping facilitate conversations with people, rather a merely one-way communications.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_VQUP0Ije2cCoADYq.jpg)\n\n_Inside the Public Servant’s Studio: In-depth conversations of emerging themes within the City Accelerator Cohort_\n\nIn discussing trust-building, the Atlanta team reiterated the importance of working with people who have well-established relationships in communities. Building trust is a long-term process, but it can help cities be more proactive rather than reactive in how they interact with their constituents. While building trust is a priority, Atlanta’s academic lead Chris LeDantec explained that a lack of trust can be productive at times since that tension can motivate progress. The participants had more of a chance to reflect on the themes of design-thinking, internal municipal communications infrastructure, and trust-building through plotting out in a creative matrix how they might address different stakeholders needs through these lenses.\n\nFollowing a full day of unpacking city engagement practices and lessons, the cohort joined a panel on [Community Engagement through the Lens of Criminal Justice Reform](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/community-engagement-through-the-lens-of-criminal-justice-reform-tickets-19016452722). The backgrounds of the powerful speakers ranged from nonprofits to governmental agencies. They spoke about new trauma-informed care approaches in their work and ways of activating community members to help with the reentry process. Many connections were explained through first-hand accounts such as the huge tie between incarceration and homelessness. One of the final panel questions asked, “What does it take to shift from punitive corrections practices to restorative ones?” and a consensus response expressed that, “Reentry shouldn’t start when you come out of, but when you enter jail**”.**\n\nThe next convening for the City Accelerator is in April 2016 where city teams will share how the implementation phases of their projects are going. In the meantime, cities are continuing to analyze their findings from Phase I, learn from each other in thematic monthly calls, and plan ahead for successful implementations.\n\n### Resources on Community Engagement Implementation\\*\n\n[Field Guides to Ensuring Voter Intent by the Center for Civic Design](http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/)\n\n[Code for America Engagement Toolkit](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/boulder/toolkit/)\n\n[IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.iap2.org/resource/resmgr/imported/IAP2%20Spectrum_vertical.pdf)\n\n[National Standards for Community Engagement](http://www.scdc.org.uk/what/national-standards/)\n\n[UCL Public Engagement Toolkit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/public-engagement/evaluation/toolkits)\n\n[National Assembly of Wales Public Engagement Toolkit](http://www.assembly.wales/NAfW%20Documents/public_engagement_toolkit_2014.pdf%20-%2007052014/public_engagement_toolkit_2014-English.pdf)\n\n[Inclusive Outreach and Public Engagement Guide — City of Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/RSJI/GRE/IOPEguide01-11-12.pdf)\n\n[National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement](http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/)\n\n[Engagement Technology for All: Best Practices for Using Technology in Engaging Underrepresented Communities in Planning](http://sustainablecommunitiesleadershipacademy.org/resource_files/documents/PlaceMatters_EngagementTechForAll_Final_20140310.pdf)\n\n[Digital Sustainability Conversations: How Local Governments can Engage Residents Online](http://sustainablecommunitiesleadershipacademy.org/resource_files/documents/community-social-engagement-guidebook-and-case-studies.pdf)\n\n_Originally published at [engagementgamelab.org](http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/2015/12/city-accelerator-cohort-ii-fall-2015-convening-recap/) on December 10, 2015._\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2016-02-05T05:00:00Z"},"key":"city-accelerator-cohort-ii-fall-2015-convening-recap","__v":0}

The experience provides CMAP graduate students the unique opportunity to teach others what they have learned, a skill core to pedagogical mission of the CMAP program.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_XVbtiAT8fbaxtiUnVxo5_g.png)\n\nAnyone interested in learning more about the CMAP program or applying should reach out to Christina Wilson at the Engagement Lab (christina at elab dot emerson dot edu).

Other memes reference historical political imagery like “The Gadsden Flag,” recent political movements — like the Egyptian Arab Spring mantra “We are all Khaled Said,”. There was even an attempt at campaign messaging construction “comparing” the two candidates’ accomplishments and potential. We also saw Romney supporters enter into the discourse, exploiting the meme to make fun of Obama, and using the same tropes as jokes, to make it full circle.\"></p>\n<p>This case sees political discourse play out as both Anti-Romney and Anti-Obama, with competing narratives when the meme hits some threshold of attention. And mainstream media plays a key role in amplifying the memes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_jZqQHDOXFYhLq8W3RSsZWw.png\" alt=\"Most Mentioned Words in Relation to “Romney” from Top 25 MSM Sources in Media Cloud during week beginning 2012–10–01\"></p>\n<p>Using the media analysis tool <a href=\"http://mediacloud.org/\">Media Cloud</a>, I found “pbs” among the most mentioned words in relation to “Romney” in stories from the top 25 most trafficked online mainstream media sources during the week of October 1, 2012.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_mY7CoA8IJzPrlEClM3Ylzg.png\" alt=\"Sentences mentioning “Romney” in Media Cloud during week beginning 2012–10–01\"></p>\n<p>Then, I used Media Cloud to browse the specific sentences mentioning PBS in those “Romney” articles.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/debate-makes-big-bird-a-big-hit-on-twitter/\">CNET article from the night of the debate</a> discussed the social media discourse around the debate and Big Bird in particular. They even drop in one of the image macros shared on Twitter, with the caption “Credit: SadBirdBird/Twitter,” actually giving credit to one of the parody Twitter accounts. The NYT’s Lede blog, which covers the media, also <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/romneys-attack-on-big-bird-sows-confusion-abroad-and-feeds-it-at-home/\">included the memes and talked about how the Big Bird debate confused international election watchers</a>.</p>\n<p>The headlines and content of these articles addressed the meme directly, and journalists used the discussion of the shared image macros and parody Twitter accounts as part of their coverage of debate performance and public opinion. And while it is impossible to say that there wouldn’t have been a significant media event around PBS and Big Bird without the intervention of hundreds of memes and thousands of tweets, these indicators help make the case for memes as legitimate political discourse.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Democratic Party and Obama Campaign immediately capitalized on the attention paid by the Internet and mainstream media to the Fired Big Bird election meme. The day after the debate the Campaign’s Tumblr account passed on <a href=\"http://barackobama.tumblr.com/post/32873587186/thedemocrats-you-cant-make-this-up-mitt\">two</a> <a href=\"http://barackobama.tumblr.com/post/32878470006/thing-meet-other-thing-via\">screenshots</a>, one of a Fired Big Bird meme <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/253845639522287616\">from The Democratic Party’s Twitter account</a> and another meme <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151426297463998&amp;\">from the Harris County Democratic Party’s Facebook page</a>. Obama was also at a rally in Denver the day after the debate where he joked,”<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoWJbTnYkY\">We didn’t know Big Bird was driving the federal deficit!</a>” And six days after the debate, the Obama Campaign released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZxs09eV-Vc\">a polished campaign ad about Big Bird</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"case-2-binders-full-of-women\">Case 2: Binders Full of Women</h1>\n<p>During the second presidential debate on October 16, Mitt Romney responds to a question about pay equity, mentioning that when he was Governor of Massachusetts he was given “binders full of women” as candidates for positions.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“And I said, ‘Well, gosh, can’t we — can’t we find some — some women that are also qualified?’ I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks?’ and they brought us whole binders full of women.”</em></p>\n<p>23-year-old experienced social media manager Veronica de Souza was watching. And while parody accounts were springing up on Twitter, she went to Tumblr, registered <a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\">bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com</a>, and started making memes and inviting others to contribute.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A-dO2U4u4EJQ-uCF9yZdDw.png\" alt=\"Many featured Trapper Keeper and Lisa Frank style imagery.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_DyLsSKKaDIRwq-iyKPW67A.png\" alt=\"There were some classic cultural references.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_JAPHohPqXZ74zGdsmaL3SA.png\" alt=\"People started photographing made-up binders in their places of work and posting them online.\"></p>\n<p>This case was strongly centered around the specific Tumblr blog created by de Souza the night of the debate. She made it open to contributions and curated them. Tumblr is designed for sharing content through its “submit” and “re-blog” features that in one click allow content to be shared on a Tumblr blog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/binders-full-of-women-tumblr/\">Mashable, then interviewed de Souza</a> after the fact. She talked about creating the Tumblr blog and a few starter memes: “It’s so easy to create a new Tumblr that is attached to your own. Creating a new Twitter account means you have to create a new email address…it’s more complicated. Also, with how fast Twitter was moving, it would be hard to break through” (Haberman 2012). She admits that she wanted to share and be noticed for her project.</p>\n<p>De Souza also reflected on the political aspect of her meme curation: “People keep asking me politically charged questions. Will it swing voters? Maybe the original statement, but not the meme” (Ibid.). She continues, “I didn’t mean it as a political statement — I just thought it was funny and I knew it would be a thing” (Ibid.).</p>\n<p>Even if de Souza didn’t believe the election meme would swing voters, the attention it drew to related issues was a potent opportunity for the Obama Campaign.

He was trying to make a point about the role of government and taking aim at the business credentials of the self-made Romney.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. […] Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own….”</p>\n<p>Republican and conservative Internet users started generating memes, eventually pulling in the Republican Party, Romney’s Campaign, and mainstream media.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1__5kmK20d_CdIG_9RbsUiOQ.png\" alt=\"Several of these election memes featured Obama dismissing famous American inventors.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_H96dS4dSgDn8RO8NnWIa4A.png\" alt=\"They skewered Democratic Party veteran Al Gore and Obama simultaneously.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_0Qf18gBCTRK-4IZIa7KN-g.png\" alt=\"Conservative groups made their own branded image macros.\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://scalar.usc.edu/works/civic-media-project/media/You%20didn%27t%20build%20that%20.gif\">You didn’t build that</a></p>\n<p><em>The Republic Party of Iowa released a branded animated gif from video of Obama’s speech.</em></p>\n<p><em>And then the GOP itself, created a set of slick branded image macros.</em></p>\n<p>After a few days of individual Internet users and independent conservative activist organizations creating memes, on July 17, the Republican National Committee’s opposition research team caught on and <a href=\"http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414504273\">generated</a> <a href=\"http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414472622\">five</a> <a href=\"http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27417610947\">GOP.com</a> <a href=\"http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414790651\">branded</a> memes, sharing them on their Tumblr blog. That same day, Romney’s Campaign Facebook page offered <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150944850036121&amp;set=a.161403756120.123284.21392801120&amp;type=1\">a shareable image</a> retorting “The Government Doesn’t Build Businesses… Hard Working Americans Do.” The next day, the lead story <a href=\"https://gop.com/obamas-hostility/\">in the RNC’s research memo</a> was “You Didn’t Build That.” The media coverage of this election meme was strong enough that the Romney Campaign held on to the message over the next two months with slogans like, “<a href=\"http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/27572407838/mitt-knows-from-experience-that-hard-working\">I built my business, Mr. President</a>,” “<a href=\"http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/28088296674/perhaps-leanne-hoagland-smith-sums-it-up-best-i\">Built by Us</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150966614426121&amp;set=a.10150583544096121.366579.21392801120&amp;type=1\">We Did Build It!</a>” and then theming the GOP Convention on August 28, “<a href=\"http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/30403468751\">We Built It</a>.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-power-of-sharing\"><strong>The Power of Sharing</strong></h1>\n<p>From the start, the popularity of these image macro memes derives in part from the relative ease of generating and sharing them. Image macro meme generator websites, like <a href=\"http://quickmeme.com/\">quickmeme.com</a>, <a href=\"http://memegenerator.net/\">memegenerator.net</a>, and <a href=\"http://imgflip.com/\">imgflip.com</a>, make it even easier by managing the process of uploading your own image and overlaying the classic bold white font with your own words added through a text box. They also host galleries of all of the memes created using the same image, which may facilitate their sharing. I argue the real power of this form of political participation is the ease of sharing.</p>\n<p>Sharing or circulating a simple image macro via personal social networks, what Jenkins, Ford, and Green call “spreadable media” (2013), represents a political speech act itself. In the networked public sphere (Benkler 2006), barriers to entry have been lowered but so to have the barriers to sharing, with ready audiences on Twitter coalescing into publics around hashtags, on Tumblr through tagging and curation, and on Facebook through shared identity construction.</p>\n<p>Shifman, Coleman, and Ward (2007) identified the growing importance of user-generated political humor during the 2005 UK general election as a form of online political participation, but the overwhelmingly cynical quality of the humor left the authors unclear on its utility to promote further participation. But looking at new social movement models like the Arab Spring, Occupy, and the Spanish <em>indignados</em>, Bennett and Segerberg (2012) identified the power of meme <em>sharing</em>, calling it the “linchpin of connective action.” They argue that sharing political memes can power “connective action networks” through personal expression shared over social networks rather than top-down forms of collective action. In some cases these networks can be organizationally-enabled through technological support and moderation to produce loosely coordinated, yet effective movements.</p>\n<p>In the case of the 2012 U.S. presidential election memes, the organizations involved in the connective action are the campaigns. In past elections, they developed the capacity to curate attention toward and shape the framing around popular user-generated political content — most notably 2008’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">Yes We Can</a>” video (Wallsten 2010). They now leverage networks of digital activists coordinating with celebrities who have large followings like those involved in the “Yes We Can” video, and backchanneling with savvy political operatives with prior campaign experience like Matt Ortega, the progenitor of several other 2012 election memes (Seitz-Wald 2012).</p>\n<p>Although this corroborates the value of connective action and the argument that election memes represent legitimate political speech acts, it also calls into question the quality of personalized expression and grassroots mobilization involved. But “authentic” and even cynical political participation through memes can coexist with their adoption and exploitation by professional political organizations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"election-memes-as-impure-dissent\">Election Memes as Impure Dissent</h1>\n<p>In a forthcoming paper, Tommie Shelby discusses hip hop as political speech act, and stresses that this form of dissent should not be understood on the model of civil disobedience: it is not meant to garner the notice of the state or other citizens to make a moral point, nor is it meant to demonstrate any moral purity or be respectable. Hip hop flaunts morally or politically objectionable content, which can lead to its dismissal by others: not unlike election memes which debase things or place them out of context to create humor.</p>\n<p>Shelby cites Albert Hirschman’s classic text <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, in which dissent comes in two forms: exit and voice, which can be used in tandem as effective political action (1970). But in cases like resignation to the current political system, or an unwillingness to emigrate, voice is the only option. And voice is meant in most cases to influence power, to alter the status quo. But Shelby argues that we should expand voice to mean symbolic expression, which can still be highly political but not concerned with ultimate impact on those in power. This is how the creation and sharing of cynical election memes make for valid political participation.</p>\n<p>The propagation of these politicized cultural artifacts may seem trivial and guilty of the slur of “slacktivism” online, but the sharing does real political work in terms of creating a moment and a networked public with power greater than the sum of its parts. Friends or followers are exposed to the sharer’s otherwise unspoken political opinions and given the opportunity to participate by forwarding the same meme they did.</p>\n<p>Meme sharing indicates there is something worth paying attention to in that moment. Maybe it is just funny. Maybe it is a little too true, which underlies the humor and implores us to pass it on. A lot of memes act as <em>shibboleths</em> — they indicate that you are part of the in-crowd, you get the joke, you were there when it happened. This is the power of the meme speech act. It quickly creates a networked public from its in-group. That feeling of inclusion can inspire further and future discourse.</p>\n<p>Shelby argues that the value of dissent may not be social or political but in how well it reaches its intended audience without having to incite them to activism. And dissent is a public act that creates a public among those it reaches. The messages of dissent call out to be agreed with, rebutted and sometimes acted upon, says Shelby, which is how memes are a form of impure dissent like hip hop, empowered by the act of sharing.</p>\n<p>There is the fear that commercialization in hip hop or professionalization in internet memes undermines this power. Shelby argues that impure dissent is a personal act of expression and will always be judged by the audience, critiquing the attitude and justification of the source. Commercial rappers simply have less political credibility. While Stromer-Galley argues that cooption of participatory culture practices by contemporary campaigns have nothing to do with democratic practice and are just about winning (2014), there are real moments of political discourse that emerge through meme sharing — these are moments of personal identity construction and negotiation to return to Shifman’s definition of internet memes. There is room and a need for sharing election memes as impure dissent and as cynical political participation, which might be amplified by campaigns but cannot be replaced by them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Benkler, Yochai. 2006. <em>The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom</em>.

[…] I like PBS, I love Big Bird, I actually like you too, but I am not gonna keep spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.”\n\nWhat emerges immediately is the proliferation of [image macro memes](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/fired-big-bird-mitt-romney-hates-big-bird), [new Twitter parody accounts](http://www.buzzfeed.com/stacylambe/big-bird-responds-to-mitt-romney-on-twitter), and a significant amount of media attention.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_yU1QAhDJHDqqvKXYa1JupA.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_x3eH3C2y2Q3FBDhXSyoU6g.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_snQSNfxsxZeZ8atmqQFa0g.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_mUxLcbpXBs_tEMTNnbVEsg.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_R8iK3hgulPC-_vtJQc-hiw.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_MJVPL7dkA2GtCTfKF6aIfA.png)\n\n![The memes played with the tropes of Sesame Street, referenced earlier political discourse around Romney’s work at Bain as well as other popular memes like the “It’s simple, We Kill the Batman” — a very common practice. Other memes reference historical political imagery like “The Gadsden Flag,” recent political movements — like the Egyptian Arab Spring mantra “We are all Khaled Said,”. There was even an attempt at campaign messaging construction “comparing” the two candidates’ accomplishments and potential. We also saw Romney supporters enter into the discourse, exploiting the meme to make fun of Obama, and using the same tropes as jokes, to make it full circle.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_9cMormfF9ydvC1DvE5-Psw.png)\n\nThis case sees political discourse play out as both Anti-Romney and Anti-Obama, with competing narratives when the meme hits some threshold of attention. And mainstream media plays a key role in amplifying the memes.\n\n![Most Mentioned Words in Relation to “Romney” from Top 25 MSM Sources in Media Cloud during week beginning 2012–10–01](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_jZqQHDOXFYhLq8W3RSsZWw.png)\n\nUsing the media analysis tool [Media Cloud](http://mediacloud.org/), I found “pbs” among the most mentioned words in relation to “Romney” in stories from the top 25 most trafficked online mainstream media sources during the week of October 1, 2012.\n\n![Sentences mentioning “Romney” in Media Cloud during week beginning 2012–10–01](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_mY7CoA8IJzPrlEClM3Ylzg.png)\n\nThen, I used Media Cloud to browse the specific sentences mentioning PBS in those “Romney” articles.\n\nA [CNET article from the night of the debate](http://www.cnet.com/news/debate-makes-big-bird-a-big-hit-on-twitter/) discussed the social media discourse around the debate and Big Bird in particular. They even drop in one of the image macros shared on Twitter, with the caption “Credit: SadBirdBird/Twitter,” actually giving credit to one of the parody Twitter accounts. The NYT’s Lede blog, which covers the media, also [included the memes and talked about how the Big Bird debate confused international election watchers](http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/romneys-attack-on-big-bird-sows-confusion-abroad-and-feeds-it-at-home/).\n\nThe headlines and content of these articles addressed the meme directly, and journalists used the discussion of the shared image macros and parody Twitter accounts as part of their coverage of debate performance and public opinion. And while it is impossible to say that there wouldn’t have been a significant media event around PBS and Big Bird without the intervention of hundreds of memes and thousands of tweets, these indicators help make the case for memes as legitimate political discourse.\n\nFurthermore, the Democratic Party and Obama Campaign immediately capitalized on the attention paid by the Internet and mainstream media to the Fired Big Bird election meme. The day after the debate the Campaign’s Tumblr account passed on [two](http://barackobama.tumblr.com/post/32873587186/thedemocrats-you-cant-make-this-up-mitt) [screenshots](http://barackobama.tumblr.com/post/32878470006/thing-meet-other-thing-via), one of a Fired Big Bird meme [from The Democratic Party’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/253845639522287616) and another meme [from the Harris County Democratic Party’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151426297463998&amp;). Obama was also at a rally in Denver the day after the debate where he joked,”[We didn’t know Big Bird was driving the federal deficit!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoWJbTnYkY)” And six days after the debate, the Obama Campaign released [a polished campaign ad about Big Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZxs09eV-Vc).\n\n# Case 2: Binders Full of Women\n\nDuring the second presidential debate on October 16, Mitt Romney responds to a question about pay equity, mentioning that when he was Governor of Massachusetts he was given “binders full of women” as candidates for positions.\n\n&gt; &gt; _“And I said, ‘Well, gosh, can’t we — can’t we find some — some women that are also qualified?’ I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks?’ and they brought us whole binders full of women.”_\n\n23-year-old experienced social media manager Veronica de Souza was watching. And while parody accounts were springing up on Twitter, she went to Tumblr, registered [bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com](http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/), and started making memes and inviting others to contribute.\n\n![Many featured Trapper Keeper and Lisa Frank style imagery.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A-dO2U4u4EJQ-uCF9yZdDw.png)\n\n![There were some classic cultural references.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_DyLsSKKaDIRwq-iyKPW67A.png)\n\n![People started photographing made-up binders in their places of work and posting them online.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_JAPHohPqXZ74zGdsmaL3SA.png)\n\nThis case was strongly centered around the specific Tumblr blog created by de Souza the night of the debate. She made it open to contributions and curated them. Tumblr is designed for sharing content through its “submit” and “re-blog” features that in one click allow content to be shared on a Tumblr blog.\n\n[Mashable, then interviewed de Souza](http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/binders-full-of-women-tumblr/) after the fact. She talked about creating the Tumblr blog and a few starter memes: “It’s so easy to create a new Tumblr that is attached to your own. Creating a new Twitter account means you have to create a new email address…it’s more complicated. Also, with how fast Twitter was moving, it would be hard to break through” (Haberman 2012). She admits that she wanted to share and be noticed for her project.\n\nDe Souza also reflected on the political aspect of her meme curation: “People keep asking me politically charged questions. Will it swing voters? Maybe the original statement, but not the meme” (Ibid.). She continues, “I didn’t mean it as a political statement — I just thought it was funny and I knew it would be a thing” (Ibid.).\n\nEven if de Souza didn’t believe the election meme would swing voters, the attention it drew to related issues was a potent opportunity for the Obama Campaign.

He was trying to make a point about the role of government and taking aim at the business credentials of the self-made Romney.\n\n&gt; &gt; “If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. […] Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own….”\n\nRepublican and conservative Internet users started generating memes, eventually pulling in the Republican Party, Romney’s Campaign, and mainstream media.\n\n![Several of these election memes featured Obama dismissing famous American inventors.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1__5kmK20d_CdIG_9RbsUiOQ.png)\n\n![They skewered Democratic Party veteran Al Gore and Obama simultaneously.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_H96dS4dSgDn8RO8NnWIa4A.png)\n\n![Conservative groups made their own branded image macros.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_0Qf18gBCTRK-4IZIa7KN-g.png)\n\n[You didn’t build that](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/civic-media-project/media/You%20didn%27t%20build%20that%20.gif)\n\n_The Republic Party of Iowa released a branded animated gif from video of Obama’s speech._\n\n_And then the GOP itself, created a set of slick branded image macros._\n\nAfter a few days of individual Internet users and independent conservative activist organizations creating memes, on July 17, the Republican National Committee’s opposition research team caught on and [generated](http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414504273) [five](http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414472622) [GOP.com](http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27417610947) [branded](http://rncresearch.tumblr.com/post/27414790651) memes, sharing them on their Tumblr blog. That same day, Romney’s Campaign Facebook page offered [a shareable image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150944850036121&amp;set=a.161403756120.123284.21392801120&amp;type=1) retorting “The Government Doesn’t Build Businesses… Hard Working Americans Do.” The next day, the lead story [in the RNC’s research memo](https://gop.com/obamas-hostility/) was “You Didn’t Build That.” The media coverage of this election meme was strong enough that the Romney Campaign held on to the message over the next two months with slogans like, “[I built my business, Mr. President](http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/27572407838/mitt-knows-from-experience-that-hard-working),” “[Built by Us](http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/28088296674/perhaps-leanne-hoagland-smith-sums-it-up-best-i),” “[We Did Build It!](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150966614426121&amp;set=a.10150583544096121.366579.21392801120&amp;type=1)” and then theming the GOP Convention on August 28, “[We Built It](http://mittromney.tumblr.com/post/30403468751).”\n\n# **The Power of Sharing**\n\nFrom the start, the popularity of these image macro memes derives in part from the relative ease of generating and sharing them. Image macro meme generator websites, like [quickmeme.com](http://quickmeme.com/), [memegenerator.net](http://memegenerator.net/), and [imgflip.com](http://imgflip.com/), make it even easier by managing the process of uploading your own image and overlaying the classic bold white font with your own words added through a text box. They also host galleries of all of the memes created using the same image, which may facilitate their sharing. I argue the real power of this form of political participation is the ease of sharing.\n\nSharing or circulating a simple image macro via personal social networks, what Jenkins, Ford, and Green call “spreadable media” (2013), represents a political speech act itself. In the networked public sphere (Benkler 2006), barriers to entry have been lowered but so to have the barriers to sharing, with ready audiences on Twitter coalescing into publics around hashtags, on Tumblr through tagging and curation, and on Facebook through shared identity construction.\n\nShifman, Coleman, and Ward (2007) identified the growing importance of user-generated political humor during the 2005 UK general election as a form of online political participation, but the overwhelmingly cynical quality of the humor left the authors unclear on its utility to promote further participation. But looking at new social movement models like the Arab Spring, Occupy, and the Spanish _indignados_, Bennett and Segerberg (2012) identified the power of meme _sharing_, calling it the “linchpin of connective action.” They argue that sharing political memes can power “connective action networks” through personal expression shared over social networks rather than top-down forms of collective action. In some cases these networks can be organizationally-enabled through technological support and moderation to produce loosely coordinated, yet effective movements.\n\nIn the case of the 2012 U.S. presidential election memes, the organizations involved in the connective action are the campaigns. In past elections, they developed the capacity to curate attention toward and shape the framing around popular user-generated political content — most notably 2008’s “[Yes We Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY)” video (Wallsten 2010). They now leverage networks of digital activists coordinating with celebrities who have large followings like those involved in the “Yes We Can” video, and backchanneling with savvy political operatives with prior campaign experience like Matt Ortega, the progenitor of several other 2012 election memes (Seitz-Wald 2012).\n\nAlthough this corroborates the value of connective action and the argument that election memes represent legitimate political speech acts, it also calls into question the quality of personalized expression and grassroots mobilization involved. But “authentic” and even cynical political participation through memes can coexist with their adoption and exploitation by professional political organizations.\n\n# Election Memes as Impure Dissent\n\nIn a forthcoming paper, Tommie Shelby discusses hip hop as political speech act, and stresses that this form of dissent should not be understood on the model of civil disobedience: it is not meant to garner the notice of the state or other citizens to make a moral point, nor is it meant to demonstrate any moral purity or be respectable. Hip hop flaunts morally or politically objectionable content, which can lead to its dismissal by others: not unlike election memes which debase things or place them out of context to create humor.\n\nShelby cites Albert Hirschman’s classic text _Exit, Voice, and Loyalty_, in which dissent comes in two forms: exit and voice, which can be used in tandem as effective political action (1970). But in cases like resignation to the current political system, or an unwillingness to emigrate, voice is the only option. And voice is meant in most cases to influence power, to alter the status quo. But Shelby argues that we should expand voice to mean symbolic expression, which can still be highly political but not concerned with ultimate impact on those in power. This is how the creation and sharing of cynical election memes make for valid political participation.\n\nThe propagation of these politicized cultural artifacts may seem trivial and guilty of the slur of “slacktivism” online, but the sharing does real political work in terms of creating a moment and a networked public with power greater than the sum of its parts. Friends or followers are exposed to the sharer’s otherwise unspoken political opinions and given the opportunity to participate by forwarding the same meme they did.\n\nMeme sharing indicates there is something worth paying attention to in that moment. Maybe it is just funny. Maybe it is a little too true, which underlies the humor and implores us to pass it on. A lot of memes act as _shibboleths_ — they indicate that you are part of the in-crowd, you get the joke, you were there when it happened. This is the power of the meme speech act. It quickly creates a networked public from its in-group. That feeling of inclusion can inspire further and future discourse.\n\nShelby argues that the value of dissent may not be social or political but in how well it reaches its intended audience without having to incite them to activism. And dissent is a public act that creates a public among those it reaches. The messages of dissent call out to be agreed with, rebutted and sometimes acted upon, says Shelby, which is how memes are a form of impure dissent like hip hop, empowered by the act of sharing.\n\nThere is the fear that commercialization in hip hop or professionalization in internet memes undermines this power. Shelby argues that impure dissent is a personal act of expression and will always be judged by the audience, critiquing the attitude and justification of the source. Commercial rappers simply have less political credibility. While Stromer-Galley argues that cooption of participatory culture practices by contemporary campaigns have nothing to do with democratic practice and are just about winning (2014), there are real moments of political discourse that emerge through meme sharing — these are moments of personal identity construction and negotiation to return to Shifman’s definition of internet memes. There is room and a need for sharing election memes as impure dissent and as cynical political participation, which might be amplified by campaigns but cannot be replaced by them.\n\n# References\n\nBenkler, Yochai. 2006. _The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom_.

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaef67172290686e460d41"},"enabled":true,"title":"Better Reykjavik: Open Municipal Policymaking\n","body":{"html":"<h3 id=\"derek-lackaff-elon-university\"><em>Derek Lackaff (</em>Elon University)</h3>\n<p>Following an economic crisis which swept away much of their wealth, international regard, and trust in established political institutions, Icelanders were in a unique position to experiment with radical new approaches to governance and citizenship. As one of the world’s most highly developed nations (95% of Icelanders are “regular users” of the internet, the highest percentage in Europe) several Icelandic grassroots initiatives attempted to leverage digital platforms to improve governmental access, transparency, and accountability (Statistics Iceland 2014).</p>\n<p>Better Reykjavik (<a href=\"https://betrireykjavik.is/\"><em>Betri Reykjavík</em></a>) is one such socio-technical initiative designed to promote citizen participation and collaborative problem solving in city governance. Better Reykjavik is a website that allows citizens to submit policy proposals to the municipal government. These ideas are publicly accessible, and may be debated by other participants and revised. The public is also encouraged to make a simple vote on each proposal — support or oppose. Over time, a body of proposals emerges, each idea refined by debate, with the aggregate list ordered by the number of votes it has received. Better Reykjavik is an “e-petition” or “open innovation” website that enables citizens to submit, debate, and prioritize policy proposals and ideas.</p>\n<p>Launched in 2009 by grassroots activists as a platform for a frustrated citizenry to express their views about how to move forward, the project was subsequently endorsed by a new political party that went on to win the Reykjavik municipal government election. The platform was later formally adopted as an official channel for citizen petitions of the government. In its four years of operation, over 70,000 people have used the platform to propose and discuss over 1,800 policy proposals and ideas, of which nearly 450 have received formal consideration from the municipal government and over 350 have been implemented or are in the process of implementation. The nonprofit <a href=\"http://www.citizens.is/\">Citizens Foundation</a> maintains the codebase as an <a href=\"https://github.com/rbjarnason/your-priorities\">open-source project</a> and has assisted in the launching of similar projects in locations ranging from the <a href=\"https://nhs-citizen.yrpri.org/\">United Kingdom</a> to the <a href=\"https://balkan-startup.yrpri.org/\">Balkans</a> to rural <a href=\"http://www.betteralamance.org/\">North Carolina</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Yr7ky0KgZW9RoKdWfgCHGg.png\" alt=\"One of the 2,000+ policy proposals submitted on the Better Reykavik site for deliberation and endorsement by the public.\"></p>\n<p>Better Reykjavik has several qualities that distinguish it from similar projects: it (1) is developed and maintained by a grassroots nonprofit organization, and not by a government, (2) rapidly achieved significant buy-in from citizens, policy-makers, and public administrators, and (3) has been normalized as an ongoing channel for citizen-government interaction. The citizen engagement and policy development process it facilitates more closely resembles crowdsourcing and aggregation platforms like Reddit than established e-petition sites such as the Obama administration’s <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/\">We The People</a> site or the <a href=\"https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/\">German Bundestag</a>’s e-petitions site.</p>\n<h1 id=\"building-a-better-reykjavik-from-e-governance-to-e-democracy\">Building a Better Reykjavik: From E-governance to E-democracy</h1>\n<p>Iceland is among the world’s “most connected” nations, and has a strong tradition of official initiatives at both the national and municipal levels to provide services to citizens via the Internet, a project often termed “e-government.” A 2005 study identified Reykjavik as one of the top 20 municipalities worldwide in digital governance, including high rankings for the privacy and security, content, and service delivery provided via its website (Carrizales, Holzer, and Manoharan 2008, 98–119). At the end of 2013, 96% of Icelandic households had a broadband Internet subscription, and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-scoreboard\">81% of citizens used eGovernment services.</a> An e-government benchmark report in May 2014 characterized Iceland as a “steady performer” with “good performance, consistently, across all priorities” in e-government implementation (Digital Agenda for Europe, 2014).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The development of new models for more open institutions and infrastructures has emerged as an important goal of both official and grassroots efforts, indicating a potential shift from service provision to civic participation and engagement.</p>\n<p>Following the 2008 economic crisis, Iceland’s political context was characterized by a massive decline in trust for incumbent politicians and institutions. A unique characteristic of many post-crisis Icelandic political initiatives is that individuals and groups without direct policy-making authority developed them: not politicians and government officials, but grassroots activists, hackers, and entrepreneurs. The “interfaces” between these projects and Icelandic policy-making institutions developed following popular interest and success.</p>\n<p>Much Icelandic attention has focused on allowing citizens easier and more effective ways to make their opinions, and more importantly, their ideas, apparent to politicians. A 2009 “National Assembly” was organized by tech entrepreneurs and activists, and brought together 1,500 Icelanders for a multimodal “envisioning” summit focused on the future of the country — the results of which were subsequently endorsed by the national parliament. A second, similar, assembly in 2010 with 950 participants launched the nation’s (in)famous “crowdsourced” constitution-crafting project (Landemore forthcoming).</p>\n<p>Better Reykjavik did not emerge fully formed, but is one of the longest-lasting and most impactful of the projects that emerged from this particular milieu for innovative civic technology. It evolved from a previous initiative called the Shadow City (<em>Skuggaborg</em>), which was opened created by grassroots activists shortly before the Reykjavík municipal elections in May 2010. Each of the eight political parties vying for seats on the council was provided with a “branded” section of the site to use to connect with potential voters, who were encouraged to submit their political priorities for debate and voting. While most of the parties utilized the site little or not at all, supporters of “anarcho-surrealist” comedian Jón Gnarr’s (2014) Best Party were encouraged to help set the agenda by using the site, and approximately 1,400 citizens joined in this process.</p>\n<p>On May 29, 2010, the Best Party defeated the incumbent Independence Party in the city council election, and subsequently entered into coalition talks with the Social Democrats. The dense social networks within the small society contributed to high awareness of the Shadow City among new city councilors. Best Party officials, having been impressed with the system and its possibilities, asked the Shadow City developers to create a website devoted to soliciting the opinions of the citizens of Reykjavík on their pact for their coalition city council. A new section of the Shadow City website called Better Reykjavík was opened, and the coalition partners encouraged citizens to use the site to share their priorities for the new government. Soon over 5,000 users were participating on the site — an impressive figure in a municipality where 56,897 votes were cast in total. Within months, several of the highest-rated ideas from the Better Reykjavík site had been placed at the top of the policy agenda listed on the Best Party website, and many were soon implemented (Visir.is 2010).</p>\n<p>Following completion of the coalition talks, citizens continued to use the Better Reykjavik site to petition the new government. In October 2011, the City of Reykjavik entered into a formal partnership with the Citizens Foundation. One component of this partnership was a commitment by the city council to address the top five priorities posted to the site each month, as well as the top priorities in each of the thirteen topical categories on this site (e.g. “environment,” “transportation,” “education”) (Anderson 2012). Over the next several years, tens of thousands of participants engaged with the site. Reykjavik city committees formally evaluated and processed hundreds of these citizen-submitted ideas, issued an official response to each, and implemented those deemed feasible.</p>\n<p>The popularity of the project with residents and city administrators alike led to further initiatives for innovative governance.

As one of the world’s most highly developed nations (95% of Icelanders are “regular users” of the internet, the highest percentage in Europe) several Icelandic grassroots initiatives attempted to leverage digital platforms to improve governmental access, transparency, and accountability (Statistics Iceland 2014).\n\nBetter Reykjavik ([_Betri Reykjavík_](https://betrireykjavik.is/)) is one such socio-technical initiative designed to promote citizen participation and collaborative problem solving in city governance. Better Reykjavik is a website that allows citizens to submit policy proposals to the municipal government. These ideas are publicly accessible, and may be debated by other participants and revised. The public is also encouraged to make a simple vote on each proposal — support or oppose. Over time, a body of proposals emerges, each idea refined by debate, with the aggregate list ordered by the number of votes it has received. Better Reykjavik is an “e-petition” or “open innovation” website that enables citizens to submit, debate, and prioritize policy proposals and ideas.\n\nLaunched in 2009 by grassroots activists as a platform for a frustrated citizenry to express their views about how to move forward, the project was subsequently endorsed by a new political party that went on to win the Reykjavik municipal government election. The platform was later formally adopted as an official channel for citizen petitions of the government. In its four years of operation, over 70,000 people have used the platform to propose and discuss over 1,800 policy proposals and ideas, of which nearly 450 have received formal consideration from the municipal government and over 350 have been implemented or are in the process of implementation. The nonprofit [Citizens Foundation](http://www.citizens.is/) maintains the codebase as an [open-source project](https://github.com/rbjarnason/your-priorities) and has assisted in the launching of similar projects in locations ranging from the [United Kingdom](https://nhs-citizen.yrpri.org/) to the [Balkans](https://balkan-startup.yrpri.org/) to rural [North Carolina](http://www.betteralamance.org/).\n\n![One of the 2,000+ policy proposals submitted on the Better Reykavik site for deliberation and endorsement by the public.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Yr7ky0KgZW9RoKdWfgCHGg.png)\n\nBetter Reykjavik has several qualities that distinguish it from similar projects: it (1) is developed and maintained by a grassroots nonprofit organization, and not by a government, (2) rapidly achieved significant buy-in from citizens, policy-makers, and public administrators, and (3) has been normalized as an ongoing channel for citizen-government interaction. The citizen engagement and policy development process it facilitates more closely resembles crowdsourcing and aggregation platforms like Reddit than established e-petition sites such as the Obama administration’s [We The People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) site or the [German Bundestag](https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/)’s e-petitions site.\n\n# Building a Better Reykjavik: From E-governance to E-democracy\n\nIceland is among the world’s “most connected” nations, and has a strong tradition of official initiatives at both the national and municipal levels to provide services to citizens via the Internet, a project often termed “e-government.” A 2005 study identified Reykjavik as one of the top 20 municipalities worldwide in digital governance, including high rankings for the privacy and security, content, and service delivery provided via its website (Carrizales, Holzer, and Manoharan 2008, 98–119). At the end of 2013, 96% of Icelandic households had a broadband Internet subscription, and [81% of citizens used eGovernment services.](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-scoreboard) An e-government benchmark report in May 2014 characterized Iceland as a “steady performer” with “good performance, consistently, across all priorities” in e-government implementation (Digital Agenda for Europe, 2014).\n\n&gt; &gt; The development of new models for more open institutions and infrastructures has emerged as an important goal of both official and grassroots efforts, indicating a potential shift from service provision to civic participation and engagement.\n\nFollowing the 2008 economic crisis, Iceland’s political context was characterized by a massive decline in trust for incumbent politicians and institutions. A unique characteristic of many post-crisis Icelandic political initiatives is that individuals and groups without direct policy-making authority developed them: not politicians and government officials, but grassroots activists, hackers, and entrepreneurs. The “interfaces” between these projects and Icelandic policy-making institutions developed following popular interest and success.\n\nMuch Icelandic attention has focused on allowing citizens easier and more effective ways to make their opinions, and more importantly, their ideas, apparent to politicians. A 2009 “National Assembly” was organized by tech entrepreneurs and activists, and brought together 1,500 Icelanders for a multimodal “envisioning” summit focused on the future of the country — the results of which were subsequently endorsed by the national parliament. A second, similar, assembly in 2010 with 950 participants launched the nation’s (in)famous “crowdsourced” constitution-crafting project (Landemore forthcoming).\n\nBetter Reykjavik did not emerge fully formed, but is one of the longest-lasting and most impactful of the projects that emerged from this particular milieu for innovative civic technology. It evolved from a previous initiative called the Shadow City (_Skuggaborg_), which was opened created by grassroots activists shortly before the Reykjavík municipal elections in May 2010. Each of the eight political parties vying for seats on the council was provided with a “branded” section of the site to use to connect with potential voters, who were encouraged to submit their political priorities for debate and voting. While most of the parties utilized the site little or not at all, supporters of “anarcho-surrealist” comedian Jón Gnarr’s (2014) Best Party were encouraged to help set the agenda by using the site, and approximately 1,400 citizens joined in this process.\n\nOn May 29, 2010, the Best Party defeated the incumbent Independence Party in the city council election, and subsequently entered into coalition talks with the Social Democrats. The dense social networks within the small society contributed to high awareness of the Shadow City among new city councilors. Best Party officials, having been impressed with the system and its possibilities, asked the Shadow City developers to create a website devoted to soliciting the opinions of the citizens of Reykjavík on their pact for their coalition city council. A new section of the Shadow City website called Better Reykjavík was opened, and the coalition partners encouraged citizens to use the site to share their priorities for the new government. Soon over 5,000 users were participating on the site — an impressive figure in a municipality where 56,897 votes were cast in total. Within months, several of the highest-rated ideas from the Better Reykjavík site had been placed at the top of the policy agenda listed on the Best Party website, and many were soon implemented (Visir.is 2010).\n\nFollowing completion of the coalition talks, citizens continued to use the Better Reykjavik site to petition the new government. In October 2011, the City of Reykjavik entered into a formal partnership with the Citizens Foundation. One component of this partnership was a commitment by the city council to address the top five priorities posted to the site each month, as well as the top priorities in each of the thirteen topical categories on this site (e.g. “environment,” “transportation,” “education”) (Anderson 2012). Over the next several years, tens of thousands of participants engaged with the site. Reykjavik city committees formally evaluated and processed hundreds of these citizen-submitted ideas, issued an official response to each, and implemented those deemed feasible.\n\nThe popularity of the project with residents and city administrators alike led to further initiatives for innovative governance. In 2012, Reykjavik started using the Better Reykjavik site to support its participatory budgeting initiative [Better Neighborhoods](https://kjosa.betrireykjavik.is/) (_Betri Hverfi_). Through 2014, the city has allocated ISK 900 million (nearly USD 8 million) to the best ideas submitted for neighborhood beautification and improvement. Residents with digitally-verified residential addresses cast their votes on the site to select projects to implement in their neighborhoods.\n\nIn the May 2014 municipal election, Gnarr declined to stand for office, and his Best Party was dissolved. A new government was formed in June 2014, with the Social Democrats entering a coalition with the colorfully named Bright Future, Left-Green, and Pirate parties.

This model is greatly supported by the fact that most key software technologies are open-source, which supports a grassroots development and participation model with very low upfront costs. Those projects that prove especially useful, such as Better Reykjavik, have successfully attracted more formal forms of financial and political support.\n\nSecond, the scale of the project was clear, and goals were clearly defined.

The practice is also beginning to be applied to projects that provide services to communities, such as public parks, community centers and grass-roots civic action (Davies 2015). Brazil offers one of the best examples of how civic crowdfunding can be used as a powerful movement building mechanism: Pimp My Carroça (Pimp My Wagon) was a public art campaign to highlight the condition of waste pickers in Sao Paulo, and to advocate for worker protections. It leveraged the emergent practice of civic crowdfunding both to gather financial resources and build a popular movement around its civic goals.</p>\n<p>Sao Paulo, a city of more than 11 million people, recycles less than 1% of its 17,000 tons of daily waste. Ninety percent of the recycling activity that occurs is carried out by waste pickers, or catadores (Offenhuber 2012; Parede Viva 2012). Despite the contribution they make to the city, however, the catadores are either ignored by the rest of the city, or face complaints and abuse from drivers and police officers, who blame them for blocking traffic. Angered by the treatment of the catadores, Mundano, a 27-year-old artist from the city, decided to intervene on their behalf (Davies 2014). In 2007 he began befriending waste pickers and offering to paint their carts, as a way of making them more visible to traffic around and giving each person he worked with an individual identity. He painted 160 carts over five years, in cities around Brazil (Mundano 2012b). The murals often contained political messages, such as “One catadore does more than an environmental minister” and “Se eu pudesse eu reciclava os politicos” (If I could I would recycle the politicians), although his primary goal was to increase public awareness of the catadores and their contribution to the sustainability of Brazilian cities (Parede Viva 2012). More often, he painted messages such as ``Eu carro não pollu’’ (My car does not pollute) and “Eu reciclo, e você?” (I recycle, what about you?) (V2 2009).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “These people… support their families through a living based on our waste. They work in the middle of the city, silently. They do work for everybody and nobody notices them. Or if they do, they say, ‘there’s a homeless person.’ It’s totally wrong… They’re employed people, working honestly. I painted carts… to make people think about this problem. This is my life’s mission.” (Mundano 2012b)</p>\n<p>But his one-man mission needed greater scale in order to have a larger impact, so in early 2012 Mundano created a crowdfunding campaign on the Sao Paulo-based platform Catarse in order to grow the movement. Mundano and the three other local graffiti artists with whom he runs Parede Viva (Living Wall), a graffiti collective and education program, named the campaign Pimp My Carroça (Pimp My Wagon, or PMC), echoing the MTV series “Pimp My Ride,” in which contestants’ cars are refitted and redecorated by professionals. The group’s goal was to raise BRL 38,200 ($17,260) to fund supplies to paint 20 waste pickers’ carts at a public event. The catadores would also be given free medical consultations from local doctors. They also planned to make a documentary film about the movement and the public art event (Mundano 2012a). They offered backers credits in the documentary, vinyl stickers, t-shirts, recycled bottles and artwork.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_S4fIBt9jq2Els-HNkvvLiQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"contagious-success\">Contagious Success</h1>\n<p>The PMC campaign opened on March 27, 2012, and during its first five days rose almost a quarter (22%) of its target. By the end of April the campaign had raised just over half of the total, and the median donation was between BRL 20 and 30 throughout this period. On May 3 the campaign received by far its biggest donation up to that point, of BRL 3,000, from a backer in Rio de Janeiro. It was the third-largest pledge the project received overall. A week later, two days before the deadline of May 11, the campaign met its target after the 704th backer pledged BRL 100. The success of the campaign was contagious. In the three days after hitting the funding target, PMC raised BRL 25,669, more than it had risen in March and April combined (One backer was recorded on May 14 due to a delay in payment processing). While the three largest backers, two of which participated in the final three days of the campaign, accounted for almost a third of the overall raise, most donations were clustered around BRL 30.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_qn6LLgTwKffwWMQoUHxE1Q.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The large volume of relatively small donations suggests that the PMC outreach strategy, which focused on email, in-person communication and social media accounts of the members of Parede Vida (PV), was very successful. Mundano tweeted 93 times about the campaign on his Twitter handle mundano_sp, receiving mentions and retweets from Brazilian celebrities with large Twitter followings, such as Sergio Marone (399,000) and film director and television host Marcelo Tas (5,000,000) (Social media analystics service Topsy). The campaign’s reach was also highly localized: four out of five backers (631) listed their address as being in Sao Paulo. Nevertheless, the project did receive nationwide attention and attracted backers from 17 of Brazil’s 27 states. The PMC campaign was a great success in terms of surpassing its goal and achieving broad-based, small-dollar support for a civic issue. It’s notable that close to half of the campaign’s 792 backers, 346 were first-time users of the Catarse platform (The data used to analyze pledging amounts and behavior was anonymized).</p>\n<p>On June 5th, over 1,000 supporters of the campaign gathered in Sao Paulo for the “pit-stop” event, at which Mundano and the PV team painted the carts of 50 waste pickers. Following the event, waste pickers and their supporters marched to the center of Sao Paulo for a rally at which they presented a manifesto calling for labor protections for waste pickers (Parede Viva 2012). The group was invited to participate in several events and exhibitions across Brazil, and as planned, made a short documentary film, which was released and circulated online.</p>\n<h1 id=\"to-curitiba-and-beyond\">To Curitiba and Beyond</h1>\n<p>In September 2013 PV opened a second PMC crowdfunding campaign on Catarse, for catadores in Curitiba.

The Curitiba “pit stop” event attracted 29 catadores and their families, 150 volunteers and doctors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_bR2Q_FHcOxfaQozHD5jcKA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>PMC Sao Paulo and its Curitiba spinoff are effective examples of tactical civic, urban interventions that can attract broad-based support from crowdfunders.

Although the campaign did not elicit a public response from policymakers, this was not the campaign’s primary intended output. Mundano and PV are happy to make rhetorical challenges to the political establishment, but their theory of change is rooted in public engagement and education, changing the discourse around waste pickers. In this respect the campaign was successful in using crowdfunding to support the building of a movement around sustainability issues. PV continues to use the PMC Sao Paulo Catarse page as a place to engage supporters and has posted eight updates to January 2014, including news from Sao Paulo and Curitiba.

Each kiosk featured a different question pertaining to one of the city’s high-profile urban design issues, inviting people to vote by pressing one of two clearly marked buttons located immediately below a slender screen (see figure 2).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_lS63e98AwFobkrCguIalBg.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Voice It kiosk on Granville Street (image credit: Tangible Interaction)\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_dCdje11CPLDCVFIK8ufH3Q.gif\" alt=\"Figure 2: Voice It kiosk (image credit: Tangible Interaction.)\"></p>\n<p>The kiosk on Granville Street provided a choice between inner-city densification, and expansion of the highway system that links Vancouver with other Lower Mainland communities. The question read, “Should we create more density in the city and expand laneway housing or create projects like the Gateway to make it easier to get to the suburbs?” and the two potential answers were “laneway” and “gateway.” The kiosk at the Woodward’s Building atrium offered a choice between high-rise and low-rise architectural styles, asking: “Vancouver is a young city whose look has shifted with the trends. What should be our signature architectural style?” The two alternatives were “super-tower” and “low-rise.” And the kiosk at the Roundhouse Community Centre provided a choice between green and social public spaces, inquiring: “What is more important, spaces like the seawall or places where we can see wall to wall people?” Possible choices were “sea” and “be seen.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_l1bcXSWj_sii1N4CAXWp8Q.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 3: Data visualization at Museum of Vancouver (image credit: Roy Bendor).\"></p>\n<p>The three kiosks were part of an installation titled Mashnotes, named after the childhood game of Mansion, Apartment, Shack, and House. It was commissioned by the Museum of Vancouver (MOV), was funded by a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, and created by Vancouver-based design outfit, Tangible Interaction. Votes cast through the kiosks were collected using the Arduino open-source microcontroller platform, sent over the cellular (GSM) network, and collated with the votes sent by text messages (SMS) and through the project’s (now defunct) website. All votes were then aggregated and displayed as a set of live data visualizations projected on large screens at the MOV’s main gallery space (see figure 3). The museum’s gallery also featured a light table that allowed visitors to pose open-ended questions and interact with them by using natural hand gestures (figure 4). Altogether, more than 2000 votes were cast, tallied, and visualized.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Mashnotes was timely. Not only was Vancouver celebrating its 125th anniversary, the city was also in the process of revisiting its growth strategy and revising several of its long-term development plans.</p>\n<p>These coincided with the city’s ambitious plan to become “the world’s greenest city by 2020.” Taking advantage of this momentum, the installation was meant to “hold a mirror up to the city and lead provocative conversations about its past, present and future.” And indeed, as told by the installation’s designer, Alex Beim, “On the city streets in particular, we noticed people didn’t just walk up to the Mashnotes Voice It kiosks, read the question and simply press an answer button. They’d actually start debating the topic with their friends or family right there. We’ve no way of knowing if those conversations continued or if they led to any action but it’s a pretty good indication that the installations sparked something.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_IEoLQxPJE7dZHFtPQJGpJQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 4: Light Table at Museum of Vancouver (image credit: Tangible Interaction).\"></p>\n<p>While the kiosks may have provoked lively conversations about some of the dilemmas facing Vancouver’s urban design and city planning, one may ask whether that was all they provoked. Could it be that the installation sparked curiosity about civic policymaking in general, or a sense of agency, evoked by the kiosks’ voting mechanism and invitation “to have a direct say”? The noticeable lack of information regarding the issues would indicate that the installation served more to instigate than to educate. Additionally, the fact that the City was not involved in funding or designing Mashnotes, and was not committed to integrating any of the opinions expressed through the kiosks into actual policy, would militate against a perception of the installation as an official surveying device or a direct channel between citizens and policymakers. Perhaps a shift in attention from the installation’s context to its actual affordances, would reveal a different kind of politicizing potential at play here. In this vein, while bearing in mind Anthony Dunne &amp; Fiona Raby’s (Dunne &amp; Raby 2013, 37) cautioning that “the power of design is often overestimated,” it could be suggested that what the installation sparked was a sense of urban design itself as a space of contention, that is, an object of politics.</p>\n<p>In this reading the installation’s rudimentary interactive affordances take on new significance. When considering the kiosks’ provocative phrasing of the questions, the avoidance of engineering or bureaucratic jargon, and the way choices were posed as contrasting dyads, Mashnotes can be seen as an instance of what Carl DiSalvo (DiSalvo 2012, 2) calls “adversarial design”: “a kind of cultural production that does the work of agonism through the conceptualization and making of products and services and our experiences with them.” So while the installation may have stripped away some of the complexity and ambiguity that are inherent to Vancouver’s urban design, it also signified the latter as a set of irreducible tradeoffs — revealing the tensions that underlie it as an essentially contested space. In this sense, the installation provided the public with an opportunity to perform the conflictual nature of urban design, and to experience it as an element of civic politics.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Dunne, Anthony &amp; Fiona Raby. 2013.

The question read, “Should we create more density in the city and expand laneway housing or create projects like the Gateway to make it easier to get to the suburbs?” and the two potential answers were “laneway” and “gateway.” The kiosk at the Woodward’s Building atrium offered a choice between high-rise and low-rise architectural styles, asking: “Vancouver is a young city whose look has shifted with the trends. What should be our signature architectural style?” The two alternatives were “super-tower” and “low-rise.” And the kiosk at the Roundhouse Community Centre provided a choice between green and social public spaces, inquiring: “What is more important, spaces like the seawall or places where we can see wall to wall people?” Possible choices were “sea” and “be seen.”\n\n![Figure 3: Data visualization at Museum of Vancouver (image credit: Roy Bendor).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_l1bcXSWj_sii1N4CAXWp8Q.jpeg)\n\nThe three kiosks were part of an installation titled Mashnotes, named after the childhood game of Mansion, Apartment, Shack, and House. It was commissioned by the Museum of Vancouver (MOV), was funded by a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, and created by Vancouver-based design outfit, Tangible Interaction. Votes cast through the kiosks were collected using the Arduino open-source microcontroller platform, sent over the cellular (GSM) network, and collated with the votes sent by text messages (SMS) and through the project’s (now defunct) website. All votes were then aggregated and displayed as a set of live data visualizations projected on large screens at the MOV’s main gallery space (see figure 3). The museum’s gallery also featured a light table that allowed visitors to pose open-ended questions and interact with them by using natural hand gestures (figure 4). Altogether, more than 2000 votes were cast, tallied, and visualized.\n\n&gt; &gt; Mashnotes was timely. Not only was Vancouver celebrating its 125th anniversary, the city was also in the process of revisiting its growth strategy and revising several of its long-term development plans.\n\nThese coincided with the city’s ambitious plan to become “the world’s greenest city by 2020.” Taking advantage of this momentum, the installation was meant to “hold a mirror up to the city and lead provocative conversations about its past, present and future.” And indeed, as told by the installation’s designer, Alex Beim, “On the city streets in particular, we noticed people didn’t just walk up to the Mashnotes Voice It kiosks, read the question and simply press an answer button. They’d actually start debating the topic with their friends or family right there. We’ve no way of knowing if those conversations continued or if they led to any action but it’s a pretty good indication that the installations sparked something.”\n\n![Figure 4: Light Table at Museum of Vancouver (image credit: Tangible Interaction).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_IEoLQxPJE7dZHFtPQJGpJQ.jpeg)\n\nWhile the kiosks may have provoked lively conversations about some of the dilemmas facing Vancouver’s urban design and city planning, one may ask whether that was all they provoked. Could it be that the installation sparked curiosity about civic policymaking in general, or a sense of agency, evoked by the kiosks’ voting mechanism and invitation “to have a direct say”? The noticeable lack of information regarding the issues would indicate that the installation served more to instigate than to educate. Additionally, the fact that the City was not involved in funding or designing Mashnotes, and was not committed to integrating any of the opinions expressed through the kiosks into actual policy, would militate against a perception of the installation as an official surveying device or a direct channel between citizens and policymakers. Perhaps a shift in attention from the installation’s context to its actual affordances, would reveal a different kind of politicizing potential at play here. In this vein, while bearing in mind Anthony Dunne &amp; Fiona Raby’s (Dunne &amp; Raby 2013, 37) cautioning that “the power of design is often overestimated,” it could be suggested that what the installation sparked was a sense of urban design itself as a space of contention, that is, an object of politics.\n\nIn this reading the installation’s rudimentary interactive affordances take on new significance. When considering the kiosks’ provocative phrasing of the questions, the avoidance of engineering or bureaucratic jargon, and the way choices were posed as contrasting dyads, Mashnotes can be seen as an instance of what Carl DiSalvo (DiSalvo 2012, 2) calls “adversarial design”: “a kind of cultural production that does the work of agonism through the conceptualization and making of products and services and our experiences with them.” So while the installation may have stripped away some of the complexity and ambiguity that are inherent to Vancouver’s urban design, it also signified the latter as a set of irreducible tradeoffs — revealing the tensions that underlie it as an essentially contested space. In this sense, the installation provided the public with an opportunity to perform the conflictual nature of urban design, and to experience it as an element of civic politics.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nDunne, Anthony &amp; Fiona Raby. 2013.

This event aims to promote cross-institutional relationships and collaboration through dialogue and creativity, reflecting on what it means to be engaged with Civic Media as a practitioner, academic and/or community partner?</p>\n<p><em>Moderator: Willow Brugh</em></p>\n<p><em>Speakers: Eric Gordon, Erhardt Graeff, Sarah Wiley, Paul Mihailidis, Catherine D’Ignazio</em></p>\n<p><strong>Eric Gordon from Emerson College- Engagement Lab</strong></p>\n<p>Eric welcomes the consortium members and introduces the event. He notes that Boston Civic Media will be funded by <a href=\"http://blog.microsoftnewengland.com/category/civic-tech/\">Microsoft Civic Engagement</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.teaglefoundation.org/\">Teagle Foundation</a>, whose mission is to encourage and enhance liberal arts education, as a crucial element within civic life. Reflecting on how we approach the liberal arts is important because it can be engaged in such ways to make more porous the lines between the University and the community. Eric emphasizes, we can use media not only as a tool for media practice, but as an object of study. The event is introduced as a kick-off for a three year grant to administer this consortium. We already have a rough outline, but today we want to ask everyone here to co-create what this will be over the next three years.</p>\n<p>There are existing projects already connecting people across disciplines such as <a href=\"http://www.bostonarearesearchinitiative.net/\">BARI</a> (Boston Area Research Initiative), <a href=\"http://urbanresearchnetwork.org/local-nodes/boston-node/#.Vp-5gVMrKV5\">URBAN.Boston</a>, <a href=\"https://civic.mit.edu/\">The MIT Center for Civic Media</a>, and <a href=\"https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/\">The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>. Considering that there are already networks connecting the people in this room, the question becomes what is needed in this regard? Within this already rich space of Boston and Civic Media, what could this group provide that is missing? We can focus on teaching and learning, seeking opportunities with a variety of institutions and engage with Boston, a localized network of academics, practitioners, and activists. We don’t want to compete with existing efforts, so how can we be additive and enrich this space in the Boston area?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://civic.mit.edu/users/willowbl00\">**Willow Brugh</a> — MIT Media Lab, Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University**</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/willowbl00\">Willow</a> lays out the rules of the road for the forthcoming discussions, which include: Respect for each other, respect the schedule, be inclusive of the people here, always keep empty chair at the table to keep things open, ask lots of questions, there are no experts in this room and no debates, as it holds the room hostage and we want to encourage the flow of dialogue.\nWillow introduces the first of the “Framing Talks,” to better understand What is Civic Media?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://civic.mit.edu/blog/erhardt/balancing-deep-and-wide-impacts-in-the-design-of-civic-tech\">Erhardt Graeff</a> <strong>from MIT Center for Civic Media</strong>\nTo address the question of “What is Civic Media?” Erhardt approaches it from the perspective of making media, building communities and designing tools to affect change. For example, young people who create and share a political joke represents a form of engaging in political discourse, building up a community, participatory practice, and effectively creating their own public.\n<strong>3 Pillars of Civic Media:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Open and accessible</strong> — tools which allow for participation</li>\n<li><strong>Participatory and Community building</strong> — creating opportunities to be heard and to set an agenda</li>\n<li><strong>Foster or Enhance Civic Engagement</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In order to ensure these values translate into the project at hand, he emphasized that “Participatory civics demands participatory design.” Erhardt’s current project <a href=\"https://civic.mit.edu/promise-tracker\">Promise Tracker</a> explores the question, “how can citizens hold elected leaders accountable for promises that they made during the campaign season?” Promise Tracker is a tool currently being piloted in Brazil, allowing citizens to prioritize issues most important to them. They are able to see the origin of a promise, participate in collecting data and track the promises politicians make taking the necessary action if they are not fulfilled. The project enables young people to become more active and engaged members in their own community, surveying, recording data, and Erhardt says, “making data to make change, not just making media.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_GMNzLX1tWIzYFM38.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By building a technology that is able to facilitate change in meaningful ways, we think this is one way we can contribute to building community here at Boston Civic Media.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/faculty/sara-wylie\">**Sara Wylie</a> from Northeastern University- Public Lab**\nSara investigates the political heart of civic media work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6b-8ddFNFOrBaOwb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong><em>“Thus we seek to bestir the people into an awareness of their own condition, provide inspiration for their thoughts and rouse them to pursue their true insights”</em></strong></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Knight\">John S. Knight</a>, 1969)</p>\n<p>Sara has developed <a href=\"https://publiclab.org/\">Public Lab</a>, an open network community of educators, technologists, researchers and community organizers working in collaboration to find low cost solutions for monitoring air, water and land. The group aims to help rural communities self-determine and act collectively to protect their environment, health and communities from extractive industries. This initiative uses accessible and inexpensive DIY techniques to create, for example, alternative grassroots mapping approaches in contrast to the more broad use of public satellite imagery, a tool she says which tends to centralize knowledge. This work is connected to civic technoscience, where we question the state of things, rather than serving a state. We ask questions like:</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>“How do we build systems and community owned tools, so that research can be scaled across communities?”</em></p>\n<p>Sara says, <em>“For me civic media is away of building civic science and connecting the practice of democracy.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.emerson.edu/academics/faculty-guide/profile/paul-mihailidis/3000\">**Paul Mihailidis</a> from Emerson College — Engagement Lab and The Civic Media Project**</p>\n<p><strong>Depiction of Civic Media</strong>\nCivic Media for us includes “the technologies, designs and practices that produce and reproduce the sense of being in the world with others toward common good. While the concept of ‘common good’ is deeply subjective, we use term to invoke the good of commons or action taken that benefit a public outside of the actors intimate sphere.”\nPaul notes, that they chose ‘common good’ because it encapsulates intentionality, a move beyond the personal and into the public realm.\nThe “_civic_” in Civic Media is not about outcomes, but about process and potential. It is about the mechanics of acting in the world with the tools and conditions available. It represents a mediated practice enabling a community to imagine themselves as being connected, not through achieving but through striving for common good.</p>\n<p>Eric and Paul co-edited a book, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/civic-media\">Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice (2016).</a> It is a collection of thematic essays to frame the idea of Civic Media. The book includes 19 chapters, 25 case studies, and brings in scholars and practitioners from diverse fields, with the hope of finding a common language and purpose.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_XCnTK-cfQboPr-2K.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Paul notes that in order to be relevant, it needs to be theoretically informed. To make the theories from the book come to life, Paul and Eric have received many short case studies that mirror sections in the book, presented as an extension of the book and meant to activate ideas on politics, play and creativity, systems and design among others. The case studies can be found on the <a href=\"http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/index\">Civic Media Project.</a> The goal is to connect theory to practice by using case studies that are representative of real world accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Civic Speed Dating</strong>\nParticipants were encouraged to chat with people they’ve never talked to before, explain some of the challenges they’re facing and what you are up to in pairs.</p>\n<p>Upon this instruction, the tables were pushed aside and chairs were placed so people were forced to encounter one another. A series of passion-filled discussions ensued, ranging from urban planning and community media (<a href=\"https://connect.mit.edu/author/nse-umoh-esema\">Nse Esema</a>, program director, executive editor at <a href=\"http://colab.mit.edu/\">MIT’s CoLab</a> Radio), to working with urban data and urban systems data collecting insights into how cities and people behave, (<a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/architecture/people/kristian-kloeckl/\">Kristian Kloeckl</a>, associate professor of Art + Design and architecture at Northeastern University and previously research scientist with the Real Time City Group Lead at <a href=\"http://senseable.mit.edu/\">MIT’s Senseable City Lab</a>), to socially engaged, interdisciplinary art as a means to collaborate with communities and build connections (<a href=\"http://readysubjects.org/portfolio/\">Sarah Kanouse</a>, interdisciplinary artist, writer and associate professor of Media Arts at Northeastern University). A common thread of concern emerged from these “dates”, articulated by <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/faculty/daniel-t-obrien\">Daniel O’Brien</a> (Assistant Professor at Northeastern University focusing on the psychology and sociology of urban neighborhoods and research director of the Boston Area Research Initiative), who asked,</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>“Where does community come in? We’re working with data that the community is generating, but where is the community’s agency?”</em></p>\n<p>The Civic Speed Dating was followed by a brief period of reflection, during which people huddled together, still fervently exchanging ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Consortium Introduction</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kanarinka.com/\">Catherine D’Ignazio</a>, Professor in Journalism of Civic Media and Data Visualization at Emerson College, a fellow at the Engagement Lab and founding member of Boston Civic Media</p>\n<p><strong>Goals &amp; Structure</strong>\nCatherine discusses the structure and nuts and bolts of how we’re seeing this effort move forward.\n<strong>Goals Include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Building relationships</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sharing knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Co-developing a curriculum</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The purpose of this meeting is to begin building the relationships with each other to gain knowledge about different institutions, and projects currently in the works, building cross-institutional ties.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Structure:</strong>\nWe want a successful organization that is not too onerous.\nWith the grant we received over the Summer from the Teagle Foundation, we have structured this organization to include:</p>\n<p><strong>-Coordinator:</strong> Becky Michelson our point person for organization!</p>\n<p><strong>-Faculty organizers:</strong> Catherine, Eric and Paul</p>\n<p><strong>-Faculty Steering Members, 40 (approx.):</strong> “Ya’ll.” We’re interested in adding more racial and gender diversity to this group. Boston has historically been a majority minority city, and so we are aiming to move beyond the usual suspects, to also include members from community colleges, for example among others.</p>\n<p><strong>-Network Members 250 (approx.)</strong>: This includes Boston- based community partners, government entities and funders. We are all teaching in collaboration with this wider network which we are also interested in growing, and we want to keep them in the loop, inviting them to our annual conference.</p>\n<p>With funding for this network for three years, what could be accomplished?</p>\n<p><strong>Agenda</strong>\nWe will have four meetings annually</p>\n<p>-The kick-off meeting, today!</p>\n<p>-Partnered pedagogy at District Hall- Faculty and community partners will discuss models, best practices and failures (Jan. 29th 2016)</p>\n<p>-Theme &amp; Location (TBD) -We would love your input here! (Apr. 15th, 2016) We would love to have this at another institution, and maybe we can discuss the theme of this meeting today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bostoncivic.media/metricsandmethods2015/\">-Annual Conference</a> at <a href=\"http://microsoftnewengland.com/\">Microsoft NERD</a> (New England Research and Development Center) — The entire network and the public are invited (Jun. 10th, 2016). This is a chance for us to present our work over the past year to the larger network, members and public.</p>\n<p><strong>Communications Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<p>Join <a href=\"http://bostoncivicmedia@groups.io\">bostoncivicmedia@groups.io</a> for the Boston Civic Media (BCM) network, where we will be posting any upcoming events at institutions, relevant calls for research, any opportunities including jobs, internships, etc. Feel free to send any relevant work or events, even if they are not located directly in Boston.\nWe will be using this space to put together our Quarterly Newsletter, which will go out to BCM network.</p>\n<p><strong>What could be most useful to people in this room?</strong>\n<a href=\"http://bostoncivic.media/syllabus-directory/\">The BCM Syllabus Directory</a>: The goal being, since we have shared interests and similar forms of practice for example, participatory design models or data storytelling, we can build an online depository to share our work, references etc. We have about 30 syllabi contributed thus far, with about eight institutions represented, so we would love to have more, please contribute! Catherine gave a demo of accessing the syllabus directory and encouraged its use.</p>\n<p><strong>The Future</strong>\nThese are just some of the things we’ve been thinking about, but it is also about you all contributing with what you see as possible. In the future we hope to continue:</p>\n<p><strong>-Building relationships</strong> across institutions by leveraging local knowledge within the community.</p>\n<p><strong>-Building curriculum</strong> through collaborative syllabus development, running courses at the same time, developing course modules together, taking courses on field trips (shared outings), allowing students from other institutions into your classes. For example, Catherine says she has spoken with consortium member Dorris Sommer about having an underground economy, where professors in Boston can give permission to students to sit in on their classes without going through the registrar’s office.</p>\n<p><strong>-Building Institutional Connections</strong>, with cross-listed classes for example or shared graduate programs. There are a lot of things possible here, however on the institutional level things might take longer.</p>\n<p><strong>-Building Shared Resources and Projects</strong>. For example, the syllabus directory, Community IRB project, (Community-based institutional Review Board) and what else? With the Community IRB project, we are currently seeking a research assistant and project coordinator to help establish shared criteria and collaboratively written set of ethical standards which organizations can use to evaluate research partnerships, ensuring that the relationship is not extractive, but rather mutually beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>-Q&amp;A Period</strong>\nEric — I think the question is, we think this is a great project to work collaboratively on (referring to the Community IRB Project). The design right now is based on a number of focus groups within the community. The research plan is that we do that for the next couple of months, getting a core group of individuals to help and a core group of organizations to ratify this over the next year. We think this is a local effort, where we see how it works in Boston, and then depending on how it goes, we can extend this to different localities. Moving forward, we either want an incredible grad student, or researcher, we can form a collaborative process with people in this room and beyond. Maybe what we should do first, is figure out core group and then move forward. I would love for our January meeting, if we can present what we’ve done so far.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://schock.cc/\">-Sasha Costanza-Chock</a> (<a href=\"http://cmsw.mit.edu/\">MIT, Comparative Media Studies</a>)- I was thinking maybe to broaden the criteria for this position, to include someone perhaps with a community organizing background?\nEric-Yes that’s a great idea.</p>\n<p>-Q- Who is benefiting from this project? Should we consider a more democratic focus, where the impetus of the group would be to become broader, more open and representative of under-represented groups? Asking ourselves the question,_ “How would the person on the street articulate ‘Civic Media’?”_</p>\n<p><strong>-Catherine</strong>- we are bound in a certain sense by the funder, the Teagle Foundation, which has an undergraduate focus. So in a way we are bound by that, but how do we connect our research to this? I think community IRB is an example of our ability to connect our research interests with that focus. We will see how our research develops and reflect on what are our own gaps might be? Who are our community partners? Maybe we’re ignoring a geographic swath of Boston? How do we make a more concerted effort to address these gaps?</p>\n<p><strong>-Eric</strong>- I don’t think anyone’s wedded to the term “Civic Media,” but maybe using other more recognizable terms might be a good thing. We struggled to keep this meeting to just faculty, we struggled with that, but we wanted today to stay focused on structure and agenda-setting going forward. I want to point out a necessary tension, we are not naive that people are competing for resources, we want to share and open this organization to community partners, but we also want to keep the conversation open, to address when we are competing with each other and we want to be strategic about it.</p>\n<p><strong>-Q</strong>- What is the level of student involvement?</p>\n<p><strong>-Catherine</strong> — None thus far. Maybe Erhardt, but this is something to work on!</p>\n<p>Next the participants started to self organize into topical groups to address long-term strategic planning for the consortium. The prompt was to, “be constructively selfish”, meaning not to over promise or over extend ourselves, so when we talk about what we want to see (ideally), it must also serve us personally, so that we will take the time for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q- “What is the criteria?”</strong>\n<strong>Paul</strong>- Address the three main areas of funder’s criteria:</p>\n<p>-Pedagogy- shared, partnerships</p>\n<p>-Reinventing or blending research and education, our work in communities and how can we use collaborative power and wealth of resources to work with communities?</p>\n<p>-Grant has mandate for diverse inclusion, to show that this consortium is diverse and inclusive.</p>\n<p><strong>Eric</strong>- I would just add, ignore the funder, I would hate to have that guide the group. We need to find things that compel us, that we are excited about.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideation and Agenda-Setting for the rest of the Year</strong>\nGroups focused on:</p>\n<p>-Group theme</p>\n<p>-End objective, what does success look like?</p>\n<p>-Idea of how to get there</p>\n<p><strong>Report Backs from the Groups</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. Art and Civic Media</strong></p>\n<p>-Looked at how social media tools can be effective for changing perceptions of users, to re-frame their experience of the world. However, there exists great divergence in outcome assessment especially in the visual arts.</p>\n<p>-Aim of creating a group, as space to use the language of visual arts and social, civic media practice to inform one another.</p>\n<p><strong>B. Journalism</strong></p>\n<p>-How do we help each other get better at working with outreach partners to have a more inclusive impact in a learning setting?</p>\n<p>-Producing standards and case studies, examples, or coming up with an experiment that is open for critique.</p>\n<p>-A focus on access of engagement</p>\n<p><strong>C. Community IRB Group</strong></p>\n<p>-Focus on understanding what these terms mean? IRB and Community?</p>\n<p>-Creating a contract allowing for mutual benefit, a scale from non-disclosure to consent, to mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>-We talked about the process of engaging community organizations, where that starts and ends? What scale are we working on?</p>\n<p>-Coming up with a language that is mutually beneficial.</p>\n<p>-Having some influence within the for-profit as well as the philanthropic sector.</p>\n<p>-A document that could be included in tenure files, etc. with the aim of changing the culture of university institutions</p>\n<p><strong>D. Humanities and its impact on today’s communicatio</strong>n</p>\n<p>-What can we use from this tradition? To build in to urgent projects (presentist) the range of interpretations, historical experiences, and/or conflicts that exist, as a means to spark dialogue. Speaking across real social divides, as an element of aesthetics, we would like to see built in.</p>\n<p>-Coming up with an ideal curriculum, or core courses. For example a course titled: <em>Aesthetics: Reflection on Civic Agency</em>, incorporate into artistic and civically-minded projects.</p>\n<p><strong>E. Development Group, action research and tech. dissemination</strong></p>\n<p>-Civic media for development.</p>\n<p>-Building a shared resource, using classes to look at design of civic media to sustain the impact and work with communities moving forward.\n<em>Could we co-design pedagogy for civic media, for development?</em></p>\n<p><strong>F. Co-Design</strong></p>\n<p>-For example, <a href=\"http://www.nonevent.org/past/o_a_my_eyesmy_ears_district_ha/\">the sonic commons</a></p>\n<p>-Developing a shared object or process that courses being taught across the city could use together. For example, environmental sensing, measuring water quality using a shared tool and shared space to collaborate.</p>\n<p>-Important to have informal collaborations as well as formal ones.</p>\n<p>-For example we could have a Disco-Tech, as a Boston Civic Media event, as a low commitment, city-wide event, taking place in a community setting.</p>\n<p>-Connecting course modules to research projects. Investigating similar questions and building through the courses a shared research project.</p>\n<p><strong>Willow</strong> — 5 minutes to complete this next part.</p>\n<p>First Activity — write on sticky notes and post around the room\n“I will” — a personal deadline — accountability — by when and who\n“we should” — longer goals for the group\n“Don’t forget” — for next gathering</p>\n<p>Second activity — Start building map of the space — of partners you are with and who you would like to connect with.

How to encourage people to linger after the event? A different setting, a more intimate space? On a conceptual level, important questions moving forward include:</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>How can we incorporate democratic values of inclusivity, diversity and co-creation into the model? How can we better address real community needs? How do we balance the tension between doing this while still meeting the funding criteria? And how can we ultimately sustain the momentum moving forward from this event?</em></p>\n<p><em>Originally published at <a href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/2016/01/recap-boston-civic-media-kick-off-event/\">engagementgamelab.org</a> on January 20, 2016.</em></p>\n","md":"\n_Live-blogged by: Renee Siobhan_\n\nAs a follow-up to the [Boston Civic Media Conference](http://issuu.com/engagementlab/docs/bcmmm-program-print_2) this past June, today’s kick-off event is for consortium members to proceed forward with this project in a collaborative and co-creative manner. This event aims to promote cross-institutional relationships and collaboration through dialogue and creativity, reflecting on what it means to be engaged with Civic Media as a practitioner, academic and/or community partner?\n\n_Moderator: Willow Brugh_\n\n_Speakers: Eric Gordon, Erhardt Graeff, Sarah Wiley, Paul Mihailidis, Catherine D’Ignazio_\n\n**Eric Gordon from Emerson College- Engagement Lab**\n\nEric welcomes the consortium members and introduces the event. He notes that Boston Civic Media will be funded by [Microsoft Civic Engagement](http://blog.microsoftnewengland.com/category/civic-tech/) and the [Teagle Foundation](http://www.teaglefoundation.org/), whose mission is to encourage and enhance liberal arts education, as a crucial element within civic life. Reflecting on how we approach the liberal arts is important because it can be engaged in such ways to make more porous the lines between the University and the community. Eric emphasizes, we can use media not only as a tool for media practice, but as an object of study. The event is introduced as a kick-off for a three year grant to administer this consortium. We already have a rough outline, but today we want to ask everyone here to co-create what this will be over the next three years.\n\nThere are existing projects already connecting people across disciplines such as [BARI](http://www.bostonarearesearchinitiative.net/) (Boston Area Research Initiative), [URBAN.Boston](http://urbanresearchnetwork.org/local-nodes/boston-node/#.Vp-5gVMrKV5), [The MIT Center for Civic Media](https://civic.mit.edu/), and [The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/). Considering that there are already networks connecting the people in this room, the question becomes what is needed in this regard? Within this already rich space of Boston and Civic Media, what could this group provide that is missing? We can focus on teaching and learning, seeking opportunities with a variety of institutions and engage with Boston, a localized network of academics, practitioners, and activists. We don’t want to compete with existing efforts, so how can we be additive and enrich this space in the Boston area?\n\n[\\*\\*Willow Brugh](https://civic.mit.edu/users/willowbl00) — MIT Media Lab, Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University\\*\\*\n\n[Willow](https://twitter.com/willowbl00) lays out the rules of the road for the forthcoming discussions, which include: Respect for each other, respect the schedule, be inclusive of the people here, always keep empty chair at the table to keep things open, ask lots of questions, there are no experts in this room and no debates, as it holds the room hostage and we want to encourage the flow of dialogue.\nWillow introduces the first of the “Framing Talks,” to better understand What is Civic Media?\n\n[Erhardt Graeff](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/erhardt/balancing-deep-and-wide-impacts-in-the-design-of-civic-tech) **from MIT Center for Civic Media**\nTo address the question of “What is Civic Media?” Erhardt approaches it from the perspective of making media, building communities and designing tools to affect change. For example, young people who create and share a political joke represents a form of engaging in political discourse, building up a community, participatory practice, and effectively creating their own public.\n**3 Pillars of Civic Media:**\n\n1.  **Open and accessible** — tools which allow for participation\n2.  **Participatory and Community building** — creating opportunities to be heard and to set an agenda\n3.  **Foster or Enhance Civic Engagement**\n\nIn order to ensure these values translate into the project at hand, he emphasized that “Participatory civics demands participatory design.” Erhardt’s current project [Promise Tracker](https://civic.mit.edu/promise-tracker) explores the question, “how can citizens hold elected leaders accountable for promises that they made during the campaign season?” Promise Tracker is a tool currently being piloted in Brazil, allowing citizens to prioritize issues most important to them. They are able to see the origin of a promise, participate in collecting data and track the promises politicians make taking the necessary action if they are not fulfilled. The project enables young people to become more active and engaged members in their own community, surveying, recording data, and Erhardt says, “making data to make change, not just making media.”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_GMNzLX1tWIzYFM38.jpg)\n\nBy building a technology that is able to facilitate change in meaningful ways, we think this is one way we can contribute to building community here at Boston Civic Media.\n\n[\\*\\*Sara Wylie](http://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/faculty/sara-wylie) from Northeastern University- Public Lab\\*\\*\nSara investigates the political heart of civic media work.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_6b-8ddFNFOrBaOwb.jpg)\n\n**_“Thus we seek to bestir the people into an awareness of their own condition, provide inspiration for their thoughts and rouse them to pursue their true insights”_**\n\n([John S. Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Knight), 1969)\n\nSara has developed [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), an open network community of educators, technologists, researchers and community organizers working in collaboration to find low cost solutions for monitoring air, water and land. The group aims to help rural communities self-determine and act collectively to protect their environment, health and communities from extractive industries. This initiative uses accessible and inexpensive DIY techniques to create, for example, alternative grassroots mapping approaches in contrast to the more broad use of public satellite imagery, a tool she says which tends to centralize knowledge. This work is connected to civic technoscience, where we question the state of things, rather than serving a state. We ask questions like:\n\n&gt; _“How do we build systems and community owned tools, so that research can be scaled across communities?”_\n\nSara says, _“For me civic media is away of building civic science and connecting the practice of democracy.”_\n\n[\\*\\*Paul Mihailidis](https://www.emerson.edu/academics/faculty-guide/profile/paul-mihailidis/3000) from Emerson College — Engagement Lab and The Civic Media Project\\*\\*\n\n**Depiction of Civic Media**\nCivic Media for us includes “the technologies, designs and practices that produce and reproduce the sense of being in the world with others toward common good. While the concept of ‘common good’ is deeply subjective, we use term to invoke the good of commons or action taken that benefit a public outside of the actors intimate sphere.”\nPaul notes, that they chose ‘common good’ because it encapsulates intentionality, a move beyond the personal and into the public realm.\nThe “_civic_” in Civic Media is not about outcomes, but about process and potential. It is about the mechanics of acting in the world with the tools and conditions available. It represents a mediated practice enabling a community to imagine themselves as being connected, not through achieving but through striving for common good.\n\nEric and Paul co-edited a book, [Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice (2016).](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/civic-media) It is a collection of thematic essays to frame the idea of Civic Media. The book includes 19 chapters, 25 case studies, and brings in scholars and practitioners from diverse fields, with the hope of finding a common language and purpose.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_XCnTK-cfQboPr-2K.jpg)\n\nPaul notes that in order to be relevant, it needs to be theoretically informed. To make the theories from the book come to life, Paul and Eric have received many short case studies that mirror sections in the book, presented as an extension of the book and meant to activate ideas on politics, play and creativity, systems and design among others. The case studies can be found on the [Civic Media Project.](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/index) The goal is to connect theory to practice by using case studies that are representative of real world accounts.\n\n**Civic Speed Dating**\nParticipants were encouraged to chat with people they’ve never talked to before, explain some of the challenges they’re facing and what you are up to in pairs.\n\nUpon this instruction, the tables were pushed aside and chairs were placed so people were forced to encounter one another. A series of passion-filled discussions ensued, ranging from urban planning and community media ([Nse Esema](https://connect.mit.edu/author/nse-umoh-esema), program director, executive editor at [MIT’s CoLab](http://colab.mit.edu/) Radio), to working with urban data and urban systems data collecting insights into how cities and people behave, ([Kristian Kloeckl](http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/architecture/people/kristian-kloeckl/), associate professor of Art + Design and architecture at Northeastern University and previously research scientist with the Real Time City Group Lead at [MIT’s Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu/)), to socially engaged, interdisciplinary art as a means to collaborate with communities and build connections ([Sarah Kanouse](http://readysubjects.org/portfolio/), interdisciplinary artist, writer and associate professor of Media Arts at Northeastern University). A common thread of concern emerged from these “dates”, articulated by [Daniel O’Brien](http://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/faculty/daniel-t-obrien) (Assistant Professor at Northeastern University focusing on the psychology and sociology of urban neighborhoods and research director of the Boston Area Research Initiative), who asked,\n\n&gt; _“Where does community come in? We’re working with data that the community is generating, but where is the community’s agency?”_\n\nThe Civic Speed Dating was followed by a brief period of reflection, during which people huddled together, still fervently exchanging ideas.\n\n**Consortium Introduction**\n\n[Catherine D’Ignazio](http://www.kanarinka.com/), Professor in Journalism of Civic Media and Data Visualization at Emerson College, a fellow at the Engagement Lab and founding member of Boston Civic Media\n\n**Goals &amp; Structure**\nCatherine discusses the structure and nuts and bolts of how we’re seeing this effort move forward.\n**Goals Include:**\n\n-   Building relationships\n\n-   Sharing knowledge\n\n-   Co-developing a curriculum\n\n-   The purpose of this meeting is to begin building the relationships with each other to gain knowledge about different institutions, and projects currently in the works, building cross-institutional ties.\n\n**Structure:**\nWe want a successful organization that is not too onerous.\nWith the grant we received over the Summer from the Teagle Foundation, we have structured this organization to include:\n\n**-Coordinator:** Becky Michelson our point person for organization!\n\n**-Faculty organizers:** Catherine, Eric and Paul\n\n**-Faculty Steering Members, 40 (approx.):** “Ya’ll.” We’re interested in adding more racial and gender diversity to this group. Boston has historically been a majority minority city, and so we are aiming to move beyond the usual suspects, to also include members from community colleges, for example among others.\n\n**-Network Members 250 (approx.)**: This includes Boston- based community partners, government entities and funders. We are all teaching in collaboration with this wider network which we are also interested in growing, and we want to keep them in the loop, inviting them to our annual conference.\n\nWith funding for this network for three years, what could be accomplished?\n\n**Agenda**\nWe will have four meetings annually\n\n-The kick-off meeting, today!\n\n-Partnered pedagogy at District Hall- Faculty and community partners will discuss models, best practices and failures (Jan. 29th 2016)\n\n-Theme &amp; Location (TBD) -We would love your input here! (Apr. 15th, 2016) We would love to have this at another institution, and maybe we can discuss the theme of this meeting today.\n\n[-Annual Conference](http://bostoncivic.media/metricsandmethods2015/) at [Microsoft NERD](http://microsoftnewengland.com/) (New England Research and Development Center) — The entire network and the public are invited (Jun. 10th, 2016). This is a chance for us to present our work over the past year to the larger network, members and public.\n\n**Communications Infrastructure**\n\nJoin [bostoncivicmedia@groups.io](http://bostoncivicmedia@groups.io) for the Boston Civic Media (BCM) network, where we will be posting any upcoming events at institutions, relevant calls for research, any opportunities including jobs, internships, etc. Feel free to send any relevant work or events, even if they are not located directly in Boston.\nWe will be using this space to put together our Quarterly Newsletter, which will go out to BCM network.\n\n**What could be most useful to people in this room?**\n[The BCM Syllabus Directory](http://bostoncivic.media/syllabus-directory/): The goal being, since we have shared interests and similar forms of practice for example, participatory design models or data storytelling, we can build an online depository to share our work, references etc. We have about 30 syllabi contributed thus far, with about eight institutions represented, so we would love to have more, please contribute! Catherine gave a demo of accessing the syllabus directory and encouraged its use.\n\n**The Future**\nThese are just some of the things we’ve been thinking about, but it is also about you all contributing with what you see as possible. In the future we hope to continue:\n\n**-Building relationships** across institutions by leveraging local knowledge within the community.\n\n**-Building curriculum** through collaborative syllabus development, running courses at the same time, developing course modules together, taking courses on field trips (shared outings), allowing students from other institutions into your classes. For example, Catherine says she has spoken with consortium member Dorris Sommer about having an underground economy, where professors in Boston can give permission to students to sit in on their classes without going through the registrar’s office.\n\n**-Building Institutional Connections**, with cross-listed classes for example or shared graduate programs. There are a lot of things possible here, however on the institutional level things might take longer.\n\n**-Building Shared Resources and Projects**. For example, the syllabus directory, Community IRB project, (Community-based institutional Review Board) and what else? With the Community IRB project, we are currently seeking a research assistant and project coordinator to help establish shared criteria and collaboratively written set of ethical standards which organizations can use to evaluate research partnerships, ensuring that the relationship is not extractive, but rather mutually beneficial.\n\n**-Q&amp;A Period**\nEric — I think the question is, we think this is a great project to work collaboratively on (referring to the Community IRB Project). The design right now is based on a number of focus groups within the community. The research plan is that we do that for the next couple of months, getting a core group of individuals to help and a core group of organizations to ratify this over the next year. We think this is a local effort, where we see how it works in Boston, and then depending on how it goes, we can extend this to different localities. Moving forward, we either want an incredible grad student, or researcher, we can form a collaborative process with people in this room and beyond. Maybe what we should do first, is figure out core group and then move forward. I would love for our January meeting, if we can present what we’ve done so far.\n\n[-Sasha Costanza-Chock](http://schock.cc/) ([MIT, Comparative Media Studies](http://cmsw.mit.edu/))- I was thinking maybe to broaden the criteria for this position, to include someone perhaps with a community organizing background?\nEric-Yes that’s a great idea.\n\n-Q- Who is benefiting from this project? Should we consider a more democratic focus, where the impetus of the group would be to become broader, more open and representative of under-represented groups? Asking ourselves the question,_ “How would the person on the street articulate ‘Civic Media’?”_\n\n**-Catherine**- we are bound in a certain sense by the funder, the Teagle Foundation, which has an undergraduate focus. So in a way we are bound by that, but how do we connect our research to this? I think community IRB is an example of our ability to connect our research interests with that focus. We will see how our research develops and reflect on what are our own gaps might be? Who are our community partners? Maybe we’re ignoring a geographic swath of Boston? How do we make a more concerted effort to address these gaps?\n\n**-Eric**- I don’t think anyone’s wedded to the term “Civic Media,” but maybe using other more recognizable terms might be a good thing. We struggled to keep this meeting to just faculty, we struggled with that, but we wanted today to stay focused on structure and agenda-setting going forward. I want to point out a necessary tension, we are not naive that people are competing for resources, we want to share and open this organization to community partners, but we also want to keep the conversation open, to address when we are competing with each other and we want to be strategic about it.\n\n**-Q**- What is the level of student involvement?\n\n**-Catherine** — None thus far. Maybe Erhardt, but this is something to work on!\n\nNext the participants started to self organize into topical groups to address long-term strategic planning for the consortium. The prompt was to, “be constructively selfish”, meaning not to over promise or over extend ourselves, so when we talk about what we want to see (ideally), it must also serve us personally, so that we will take the time for it.\n\n**Q- “What is the criteria?”**\n**Paul**- Address the three main areas of funder’s criteria:\n\n-Pedagogy- shared, partnerships\n\n-Reinventing or blending research and education, our work in communities and how can we use collaborative power and wealth of resources to work with communities?\n\n-Grant has mandate for diverse inclusion, to show that this consortium is diverse and inclusive.\n\n**Eric**- I would just add, ignore the funder, I would hate to have that guide the group. We need to find things that compel us, that we are excited about.\n\n**Ideation and Agenda-Setting for the rest of the Year**\nGroups focused on:\n\n-Group theme\n\n-End objective, what does success look like?\n\n-Idea of how to get there\n\n**Report Backs from the Groups**\n\n**A. Art and Civic Media**\n\n-Looked at how social media tools can be effective for changing perceptions of users, to re-frame their experience of the world. However, there exists great divergence in outcome assessment especially in the visual arts.\n\n-Aim of creating a group, as space to use the language of visual arts and social, civic media practice to inform one another.\n\n**B. Journalism**\n\n-How do we help each other get better at working with outreach partners to have a more inclusive impact in a learning setting?\n\n-Producing standards and case studies, examples, or coming up with an experiment that is open for critique.\n\n-A focus on access of engagement\n\n**C. Community IRB Group**\n\n-Focus on understanding what these terms mean? IRB and Community?\n\n-Creating a contract allowing for mutual benefit, a scale from non-disclosure to consent, to mutual benefit.\n\n-We talked about the process of engaging community organizations, where that starts and ends? What scale are we working on?\n\n-Coming up with a language that is mutually beneficial.\n\n-Having some influence within the for-profit as well as the philanthropic sector.\n\n-A document that could be included in tenure files, etc. with the aim of changing the culture of university institutions\n\n**D. Humanities and its impact on today’s communicatio**n\n\n-What can we use from this tradition? To build in to urgent projects (presentist) the range of interpretations, historical experiences, and/or conflicts that exist, as a means to spark dialogue. Speaking across real social divides, as an element of aesthetics, we would like to see built in.\n\n-Coming up with an ideal curriculum, or core courses. For example a course titled: _Aesthetics: Reflection on Civic Agency_, incorporate into artistic and civically-minded projects.\n\n**E. Development Group, action research and tech. dissemination**\n\n-Civic media for development.\n\n-Building a shared resource, using classes to look at design of civic media to sustain the impact and work with communities moving forward.\n_Could we co-design pedagogy for civic media, for development?_\n\n**F. Co-Design**\n\n-For example, [the sonic commons](http://www.nonevent.org/past/o_a_my_eyesmy_ears_district_ha/)\n\n-Developing a shared object or process that courses being taught across the city could use together. For example, environmental sensing, measuring water quality using a shared tool and shared space to collaborate.\n\n-Important to have informal collaborations as well as formal ones.\n\n-For example we could have a Disco-Tech, as a Boston Civic Media event, as a low commitment, city-wide event, taking place in a community setting.\n\n-Connecting course modules to research projects. Investigating similar questions and building through the courses a shared research project.\n\n**Willow** — 5 minutes to complete this next part.\n\nFirst Activity — write on sticky notes and post around the room\n“I will” — a personal deadline — accountability — by when and who\n“we should” — longer goals for the group\n“Don’t forget” — for next gathering\n\nSecond activity — Start building map of the space — of partners you are with and who you would like to connect with. A Community partner map.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_upwPJlRUSoEXhOEt.jpg)\n\n**Concluding Remarks**\n\nAnd as a flurry of sticky notes assume their positions on the walls of the room, Boston Civic Media’s Kick-Off event concludes.\nThings to think about in the future are- How can we better create an environment for these events that might enable relationships to develop in more depth? How to encourage people to linger after the event? A different setting, a more intimate space? On a conceptual level, important questions moving forward include:\n\n&gt; _How can we incorporate democratic values of inclusivity, diversity and co-creation into the model? How can we better address real community needs? How do we balance the tension between doing this while still meeting the funding criteria? And how can we ultimately sustain the momentum moving forward from this event?_\n\n_Originally published at [engagementgamelab.org](http://engagementgamelab.org/blog/2016/01/recap-boston-civic-media-kick-off-event/) on January 20, 2016._\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2016-02-05T05:00:00Z"},"key":"recap-boston-civic-media-kick-off-event","__v":0}

Its formal legal structure establishes robust requirements for transparency and public participation. Rulemakers are required to notify the public of what is being proposed, explain the underlying legal and policy rationales, and provide supporting data. Participation is formally guaranteed by a period during which anyone may comment on a proposed rule. Further, all comments must be reviewed and considered.</p>\n<p>However, in practice, meaningful public comment has been highly selective, dominated by industry groups, professional associations, and other well-resourced entities (Kerwin 2003). Both the Bush and Obama Administrations have tried to remediate this and broaden public participation in rulemaking through Regulations.gov, a government-wide rulemaking portal where people can find rulemaking documents and submit comments. Still, observers generally agree that, while the overall number of comments has increased — principally from mass, form-comment campaigns by advocacy organizations (Shukman 2009, 23–53) — effective participation by individuals, small businesses, non-governmental organizations, and other missing stakeholders remains elusive (Balla and Daniels 2007, 46–67; Coglianese 2006, 943–968).</p>\n<p>CeRI (the Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative), a cross-disciplinary group of researchers in law, communication, conflict resolution, and computing and information science, created <a href=\"http://regulationroom.org/\">RegulationRoom</a> with the goal of engaging missing stakeholders in the policymaking process (Storms 2013). As an action-research platform for online civic engagement, RegulationRoom can reach stakeholders nationwide in ways that would not be possible offline. In collaboration with the Department of Transportation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, six live rulemakings have been hosted on the platform.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_bPUJvdv9LHYwpGNIxsBC6Q.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The use of web-based tools has long been promoted as a means to lower the cost of public engagement in policymaking and other forms of political activism (Shirky 2008). RegulationRoom is unique, however, in its conception as a socio-technical system. Some civically oriented platforms, such as Ideascale and Change.org, rely primarily on technological tools rather than human support to structure participants’ engagement with policymakers. In contrast, RegulationRoom calls for a more hands-on approach to engagement engineering where technological tools and facilitative engagement practices are closely intertwined.</p>\n<p>Drawing on the design-based research paradigm, the RegulationRoom team pursues iterative analysis, design, development, and implementation based on experimentation and observation in the field (Wang and Hannafin 2005, 5–24; Reimann 2011, 37–50). To these ends, we employ a range of mixed methods including web-analytics, surveys, and online ethnographies. Our research so far suggests that supporting broader, better public participation involves a combination of strategically designed technology and human effort over five stages: (1) choosing an appropriate rule, (2) identifying, alerting, and engaging missing stakeholders, (3) information design, (4) facilitative moderation, and (5) closing the loop (Farina et al. 2011, 382–463).</p>\n<h1 id=\"choosing-a-rule\">Choosing a rule</h1>\n<p>Getting public input that is more thoughtful and nuanced than mere expressions of outcome preferences takes time and effort. Not all rulemakings justify this resource investment. Some proposals require specialized technical expertise or impact only a narrow range of stakeholders who are already engaged in the traditional process. Investing in broader public participation is most likely to yield value where there exist (i) one or more substantial groups of missing stakeholders (ii) who are likely to have relevant “situated knowledge”: i.e., information about likely impacts, causation, etc based on first-hand experience with the problems the rule addresses and the circumstances of its implementation (Farina et al. 2012, 123–217).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLQJpAJEQhI&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/lLQJpAJEQhI/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"identifying-alerting-and-engaging-new-voices\">Identifying, Alerting, and Engaging New Voices</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://regulationroom.org/\">RegulationRoom</a> works with agency partners to identify missing stakeholder groups and determine where and how these groups get information. Targeted conventional and social media outreach, based on this research, tries to motivate participation by (i) explaining how the proposed rule would affect these stakeholders and (ii) emphasizing their legal right to participate and the government’s legal responsibility to review every comment before making a final decision (Farina et al. 2014, 16–40). The ability to recruit participants using social media has provided the research team with opportunities to experiment with the framing of calls to action, with the goal of determining effective frames to motivate engagement in policy deliberation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"information-design\">Information design</h1>\n<p>Effective participation is informed participation (Storms 2013). RegulationRoom’s platform design encourages participants to engage with the government’s proposal through a side-by-side format, which features text explaining the proposal on the left and the comment stream on the right. Unlike a traditional blog format, this model highlights the centrality of the proposal text. As such, participants are better able to learn about and critique the agency proposal with specificity. Additionally, participants must attach their comments to particular sections of text (targeted commenting); this helps participants identify sections of interest to them and provide detailed comments about their experiences or concerns related to the issue in that section. Targeted commenting also helps agencies use public input in their decision-making process, because comments are automatically organized by substantive issue. Finally, threaded commenting encourages interactive discussion.</p>\n<p>A major information design challenge is that the original rulemaking documents often total hundreds of pages of dense, jargon-filled text. Several techniques are used to render this text into site content that participants can read, understand, and discuss effectively:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Information triage: identifying the most relevant information needed for effective commenting, and packaging it in thematic topic posts of manageable length.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Signposting: cues that help participants rapidly proceed to the issues that interest them most (e.g., an index of topic posts; subtopics with short descriptive titles).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Translation: creating shorter, simpler text using plain-language writing principles.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Layering: using hyperlinks, glossaries, and other hypertext functionality to embed information in ways that allow each participant, at his/her own choice, to get deeper or broader information (e.g., reading the original rulemaking document) — or to find more help than triage and translation have already provided (e.g., definitions; background explanations).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the strategies described above applies existing technological and design tools to a new problem: how to make complex policymaking processes accessible to stakeholders who possess relevant knowledge and concerns, but lack the resources to engage in the traditional process without additional support.</p>\n<h1 id=\"facilitative-moderation\">Facilitative moderation</h1>\n<p>To actually influence the rulemaking outcome, commenters must substantiate claims with facts and reasons, acknowledge competing arguments, discuss alternatives, etc. RegulationRoom provides educational materials about effective commenting in text and video formats, but also relies on human moderators to mentor participants new to the process. Trained in conflict resolution and group facilitation techniques, moderators help participants who lack, or misunderstand, important information about the proposal by replying with clarification or providing links to additional information. To help participants articulate their knowledge, concerns, and arguments as fully as possible, moderators will pose neutral, but probing, questions for more details and the implications of a participant’s comment. Additionally, moderators may: encourage knowledgeable participants to engage more deeply with the government’s analytical documents; point out other issues, and other comments, that relate to the participant’s interests or concerns; and, where necessary, emphasize norms of candid but civil discussion.</p>\n<h1 id=\"closing-the-loop\">Closing the loop</h1>\n<p>At the close of the comment period, the RegulationRoom team creates a detailed summary of the comments; this is vetted by the community of commenters and submitted to the government as formal public input in the rulemaking process. When a rule is finalized, participants receive an email notice and can visit the site to find a description and text of the final rule, as well as pointers to where RegulationRoom commenters were mentioned.</p>\n<p>The RegulationRoom experience is rooted in and enabled through the use of social media. It demonstrates that broader, meaningful public engagement in complex policymaking is possible, but it requires more than mainly technical solutions. Instead, designing for such participation requires thoughtfulness, commitment, and resources on the part of engagement engineers. Unlike less effortful forms of public participation like voting thumbs up or thumbs down on crowdsourced ideas, which rely on aggregation of preferences or sentiment expression, genuine substantive engagement with complex policy proposals builds on socio-technical design that lowers barriers to entry and bolsters effective participation. Though brainstorming and preference aggregation tools have roles to play in civic participation, engagement engineers must ensure that participants have adequate technical and human support to effectively engage in a process — whether it is petitioning, participatory budgeting, or commenting on proposed regulations. Ultimately, they should be guided by the principle that a democratic government should not actively facilitate civic participation it does not truly value.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Coglianese, Cary. 2006. “Citizen Participation in Rulemaking Past, Present, and Future.” <em>Duke Law Journal</em> 55 (5): 943–968.</p>\n<p>Shirky, Clay. 2008. <em>Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations.</em> New York, NY: Penguin, 2008.</p>\n<p>Kerwin, Cornelius M. 2003. <em>Rulemaking: How Government Agencies Write Law and Make Policy.</em> 3rd ed.

Its formal legal structure establishes robust requirements for transparency and public participation. Rulemakers are required to notify the public of what is being proposed, explain the underlying legal and policy rationales, and provide supporting data. Participation is formally guaranteed by a period during which anyone may comment on a proposed rule. Further, all comments must be reviewed and considered.\n\nHowever, in practice, meaningful public comment has been highly selective, dominated by industry groups, professional associations, and other well-resourced entities (Kerwin 2003). Both the Bush and Obama Administrations have tried to remediate this and broaden public participation in rulemaking through Regulations.gov, a government-wide rulemaking portal where people can find rulemaking documents and submit comments. Still, observers generally agree that, while the overall number of comments has increased — principally from mass, form-comment campaigns by advocacy organizations (Shukman 2009, 23–53) — effective participation by individuals, small businesses, non-governmental organizations, and other missing stakeholders remains elusive (Balla and Daniels 2007, 46–67; Coglianese 2006, 943–968).\n\nCeRI (the Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative), a cross-disciplinary group of researchers in law, communication, conflict resolution, and computing and information science, created [RegulationRoom](http://regulationroom.org/) with the goal of engaging missing stakeholders in the policymaking process (Storms 2013). As an action-research platform for online civic engagement, RegulationRoom can reach stakeholders nationwide in ways that would not be possible offline. In collaboration with the Department of Transportation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, six live rulemakings have been hosted on the platform.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_bPUJvdv9LHYwpGNIxsBC6Q.png)\n\nThe use of web-based tools has long been promoted as a means to lower the cost of public engagement in policymaking and other forms of political activism (Shirky 2008). RegulationRoom is unique, however, in its conception as a socio-technical system. Some civically oriented platforms, such as Ideascale and Change.org, rely primarily on technological tools rather than human support to structure participants’ engagement with policymakers. In contrast, RegulationRoom calls for a more hands-on approach to engagement engineering where technological tools and facilitative engagement practices are closely intertwined.\n\nDrawing on the design-based research paradigm, the RegulationRoom team pursues iterative analysis, design, development, and implementation based on experimentation and observation in the field (Wang and Hannafin 2005, 5–24; Reimann 2011, 37–50). To these ends, we employ a range of mixed methods including web-analytics, surveys, and online ethnographies. Our research so far suggests that supporting broader, better public participation involves a combination of strategically designed technology and human effort over five stages: (1) choosing an appropriate rule, (2) identifying, alerting, and engaging missing stakeholders, (3) information design, (4) facilitative moderation, and (5) closing the loop (Farina et al. 2011, 382–463).\n\n# Choosing a rule\n\nGetting public input that is more thoughtful and nuanced than mere expressions of outcome preferences takes time and effort. Not all rulemakings justify this resource investment. Some proposals require specialized technical expertise or impact only a narrow range of stakeholders who are already engaged in the traditional process. Investing in broader public participation is most likely to yield value where there exist (i) one or more substantial groups of missing stakeholders (ii) who are likely to have relevant “situated knowledge”: i.e., information about likely impacts, causation, etc based on first-hand experience with the problems the rule addresses and the circumstances of its implementation (Farina et al. 2012, 123–217).\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lLQJpAJEQhI/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLQJpAJEQhI&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n# Identifying, Alerting, and Engaging New Voices\n\n[RegulationRoom](http://regulationroom.org/) works with agency partners to identify missing stakeholder groups and determine where and how these groups get information. Targeted conventional and social media outreach, based on this research, tries to motivate participation by (i) explaining how the proposed rule would affect these stakeholders and (ii) emphasizing their legal right to participate and the government’s legal responsibility to review every comment before making a final decision (Farina et al. 2014, 16–40). The ability to recruit participants using social media has provided the research team with opportunities to experiment with the framing of calls to action, with the goal of determining effective frames to motivate engagement in policy deliberation.\n\n# Information design\n\nEffective participation is informed participation (Storms 2013). RegulationRoom’s platform design encourages participants to engage with the government’s proposal through a side-by-side format, which features text explaining the proposal on the left and the comment stream on the right. Unlike a traditional blog format, this model highlights the centrality of the proposal text. As such, participants are better able to learn about and critique the agency proposal with specificity. Additionally, participants must attach their comments to particular sections of text (targeted commenting); this helps participants identify sections of interest to them and provide detailed comments about their experiences or concerns related to the issue in that section. Targeted commenting also helps agencies use public input in their decision-making process, because comments are automatically organized by substantive issue. Finally, threaded commenting encourages interactive discussion.\n\nA major information design challenge is that the original rulemaking documents often total hundreds of pages of dense, jargon-filled text. Several techniques are used to render this text into site content that participants can read, understand, and discuss effectively:\n\n-   Information triage: identifying the most relevant information needed for effective commenting, and packaging it in thematic topic posts of manageable length.\n\n-   Signposting: cues that help participants rapidly proceed to the issues that interest them most (e.g., an index of topic posts; subtopics with short descriptive titles).\n\n-   Translation: creating shorter, simpler text using plain-language writing principles.\n\n-   Layering: using hyperlinks, glossaries, and other hypertext functionality to embed information in ways that allow each participant, at his/her own choice, to get deeper or broader information (e.g., reading the original rulemaking document) — or to find more help than triage and translation have already provided (e.g., definitions; background explanations).\n\nEach of the strategies described above applies existing technological and design tools to a new problem: how to make complex policymaking processes accessible to stakeholders who possess relevant knowledge and concerns, but lack the resources to engage in the traditional process without additional support.\n\n# Facilitative moderation\n\nTo actually influence the rulemaking outcome, commenters must substantiate claims with facts and reasons, acknowledge competing arguments, discuss alternatives, etc. RegulationRoom provides educational materials about effective commenting in text and video formats, but also relies on human moderators to mentor participants new to the process. Trained in conflict resolution and group facilitation techniques, moderators help participants who lack, or misunderstand, important information about the proposal by replying with clarification or providing links to additional information. To help participants articulate their knowledge, concerns, and arguments as fully as possible, moderators will pose neutral, but probing, questions for more details and the implications of a participant’s comment. Additionally, moderators may: encourage knowledgeable participants to engage more deeply with the government’s analytical documents; point out other issues, and other comments, that relate to the participant’s interests or concerns; and, where necessary, emphasize norms of candid but civil discussion.\n\n# Closing the loop\n\nAt the close of the comment period, the RegulationRoom team creates a detailed summary of the comments; this is vetted by the community of commenters and submitted to the government as formal public input in the rulemaking process. When a rule is finalized, participants receive an email notice and can visit the site to find a description and text of the final rule, as well as pointers to where RegulationRoom commenters were mentioned.\n\nThe RegulationRoom experience is rooted in and enabled through the use of social media. It demonstrates that broader, meaningful public engagement in complex policymaking is possible, but it requires more than mainly technical solutions. Instead, designing for such participation requires thoughtfulness, commitment, and resources on the part of engagement engineers. Unlike less effortful forms of public participation like voting thumbs up or thumbs down on crowdsourced ideas, which rely on aggregation of preferences or sentiment expression, genuine substantive engagement with complex policy proposals builds on socio-technical design that lowers barriers to entry and bolsters effective participation. Though brainstorming and preference aggregation tools have roles to play in civic participation, engagement engineers must ensure that participants have adequate technical and human support to effectively engage in a process — whether it is petitioning, participatory budgeting, or commenting on proposed regulations. Ultimately, they should be guided by the principle that a democratic government should not actively facilitate civic participation it does not truly value.\n\n# References\n\nCoglianese, Cary. 2006. “Citizen Participation in Rulemaking Past, Present, and Future.” _Duke Law Journal_ 55 (5): 943–968.\n\nShirky, Clay. 2008. _Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations._ New York, NY: Penguin, 2008.\n\nKerwin, Cornelius M. 2003. _Rulemaking: How Government Agencies Write Law and Make Policy._ 3rd ed.

The world’s first oil well was drilled there in 1859. Since then, some 350,000 wells have been drilled in the state. Nearly 8,000 of these wells are in operation or under development as sites of fracking-based extraction, which has been underway in its current mode of operation on the Marcellus Shale since 2003. The process of fracking involves using water, sand, and a proprietary mix of chemicals, which are pounded into deep shale formations to release reserves of natural gas. A mesh of pipelines, condensate tanks, frack chemical impoundments and compressor stations assemble into landscapes of natural gas extraction. The round-the-clock activity, including a constant stream of freight-truck traffic and the din of heavy machinery generates considerable concerns about environmental disturbance, particularly in the form of water and air pollution. At every step along the course of this infrastructure, chemicals can leak into the air or be released intentionally as permitted emissions.

A common assumption may exist that technologies developed for civic engagement will seamlessly unfold into participatory encounters. Sensors for environmental monitoring are often presented as tools that will facilitate the generation of data on pollution, for instance, which are meant to lead to political engagement and efficacy. Our research has suggested that these are not technologies that are immediately “civic,” however, but that may become civic in specific ways through involvement with communities and concrete environmental problems such as air pollution related to fracking. What are the standards and conditions that lend political effect to sensing practices and data? How does pollution data circulate so as to have effect? How do communities form to convey the importance of monitoring practices and data? These are questions that ask about the civic attachments that may form in relation to technologies, but are not solved by technologies alone.</p>\n<p>Many environmental sensor devices, from the Air Quality Egg to AirCasting to Smart Citizen Sensor and more, primarily exist as proof-of-concept technologies, with the sensing capacities of these technologies producing more or less accurate data. Yet the capacities of these technologies in realizing new modes of environmental citizenship often remain untested, even while this is a recurring way in which these technologies are promoted. The Citizen Sense project has set out to put these existing technologies to work in order to understand the social, political and technical problems with which they are entangled; and to test how environmental sensing technologies operate in contexts where more emphasis is placed on the civic and political capacities of these kits in comparison to their technical inventiveness as such.</p>\n<p>In other words, the invention of technologies does not automatically lead to the invention of civic engagement. These technologies need to become civic, often in quite different ways depending upon the projects in which they would be put to work. The Citizen Sense project is raising distinct questions about the politics and practices of sense that emerge at the intersection of sensor technologies, citizen participation and environmental change. It is our contention that civic-ness does not automatically follow development of sensors for environmental monitoring. Instead, pollution-sensing technologies are provocations for thinking about how — in this case — environmental monitoring data on air pollution might be collected, communicated and acted upon, and to what effect. Citizen sensing is not just made up of observations of environmental change, but also involves technical and political practices that form a complex ecology of sensing. Environmental sensors and DIY platforms may not offer up a simple pathway from citizen-collected data to effective political action, but they do open up an expansive set of questions about how civic engagement forms attachments in and through particular technologies, how communities might assemble to address distinct environmental problems, and how digital technologies are but one part of this larger effort to invent new modes of environmental and political practice.</p>\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1>\n<p>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007–2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n. 313347, “Citizen Sensing and Environmental Practice: Assessing Participatory Engagements with Environments through Sensor Technologies.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

The project was launched by the Maker Jawn Initiative across five Free Library branches in Philadelphia, and over 1,000 youth collaborated to create murals from foam boards, markers, and low-cost networking technologies. The murals function as programmable public displays that connect local neighborhoods with online audiences. Messages about love, family, hope, and questions about violence and social justice drawn with colored markers on the mural boxes by community youth are combined with digital messages sent to the boards from the Connected Messages <a href=\"http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/connected.ecrafting.org\">website</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-youths-public-sphere\">The Youth’s Public Sphere</h1>\n<p>Youth’s involvement with civic issues greatly differs from traditional political engagement or activism. Their citizenship involves tactics matched with their skills, motivated by individual interests and a willingness to participate in discussions connected with an audience to have an impact (Soep 2014). The public sphere for civic-minded youth can include social media sites, community spaces, libraries, or makerspaces; where there they connect to each other, find mentorship, and resources for engagement. Connected Messages experiments with new models of citizenship where youth build their own public sphere. Three tactics employed include: 1) Increasing youth visibility through creating interest-driven content; 2) Connecting youth with each other through technology to reach beyond immediate communities; 3) Integrating learning, making, and civic engagement to create lasting experiences.</p>\n<h1 id=\"maker-culture-civic-engagement-and-youth\">Maker Culture, Civic Engagement, and Youth</h1>\n<p>Many spaces in children’s museums, science centers, community organizations, and maker fairs organize activities in which youth making personally relevant designs such as robots, toys, and clothing. While such designs engage youth with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, they rarely offer community-relevant designs to explore the potential of collectively designed activities that can foster civic engagement. Murals, on the other hand, have a rich tradition of depicting local cultures and historical events through messages, images, and scenes built by individuals or groups who intend to preserve their communities’ spirit. They function as public displays and landmarks that transform individual efforts into collective designs and give communal identities to urban environments. Murals, however, are often conceived as static and permanent representations. They lack the dynamic nature of digital public displays such as media facades or site-specific permanent projections that can be programmed with interactive content. Digital public displays can capture the changing nature of communities and combine the capabilities of permanent displays with real-time participation. As temporary groups and collectives emerge to learn about each other through the social interaction in public places, the dynamic murals become social catalysts. It is within this larger landscape of interactive, participatory, and public displays that the community mural, called Connected Messages, combines the empowering nature of city murals with the dynamic qualities of digital displays.</p>\n<h1 id=\"building-displays-messages-and-communities\">Building Displays, Messages and Communities</h1>\n<p><strong><em>The project embraces a do-it-yourself approach towards digital mural design as youth build re-programmable, networked public displays from cheap and everyday materials.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The displays are built pixel-by-pixel from cardboard boxes that include an LED and conductive traces. Participants use blank boxes and decorate them according to different themes with their drawings and writings. The boxes are then arranged on a grid and mounted onto foam boards. The board connects the boxes with each other and makes them individually addressable through a circuit controlled by a microcontroller. Through a wireless connection to the Internet, each board can receive messages from a website since a web user can turn on or off each box. The website features a virtual representation of the mural and web users can send animated messages to the physical murals located in different community locations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_-gwzBXYgWVQZz9KYjdPNBA.png\" alt=\"Figure 1. Foam board with copper traces (upper left), Electric Imp and a modem (upper right), back of tile boxes with copper connectors (lower left), and tile boxes with designs on board (lower right).\"></p>\n<p>The Connected Messages murals were set up and designed during the summer of 2013 in five Free Library locations in underserved neighborhoods across North and West Philadelphia, communities that have been decimated by poverty (according to the 2011 census, 65.46% of households earning less than $25,000) and crime (584.66 cases of aggravated assault/100,000 people) with fewer than 2% of adults employed in professional, scientific, and technical services. Five Maker Mentors led the mural activities, a team that consisted of three men and two women ages 21–31, with backgrounds as working artists and undergraduate students.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_NXjKO12Sh2lpOTvc2IQKOQ.png\" alt=\"Figure 2.

Connected Messages box reflecting on the Trayvon Martin trial.\"></p>\n<p>Over 1,000 youth, between ages 6–19 years, participated in Connected Messages activities, their daily participation fluctuating from three to thirty participants. Youth and mentors at each location developed themes for their board around bravery, kindness, acceptance, and anti-bullying based on Lady Gaga’s Born Brave Bus Tour, which visited Philadelphia in March 2013. While all of the branches started from Lady Gaga tour themes, different branches personalized their murals according to the interests of their participants to give a true sense of ownership in the project. One library location — embedded within a nonprofit whose mission is to reduce the recidivism of adjudicated African-American youth — created boxes that addressed recent school closings versus new prison construction, their perspectives on the Trayvon Martin trial, and choosing positivity and creative outlets over perpetuating violence. All the completed display boards were gathered for a final celebratory event at the main branch of the Free Library. During the event, local makers from different branches witnessed the boards together, learned about the different topics discussed at each branch and leveraged the opportunity to interact with a larger online community within Philadelphia.</p>\n<h1 id=\"reflections\">Reflections</h1>\n<p>The Maker Mentors encouraged youth to explore the project themes in self-directed ways that allowed for individualized levels of engagement. At the completion of Connected Messages, five Maker Mentors were interviewed about their experiences with supporting learning, production and expression of community voices, as well as their own learning. Several Mentors recalled that participants described their neighborhoods of North and West Philadelphia in a way that echoed census statistics on drug abuse, violence, and low education: “It was a bit sad to hear their initial responses of not safe, no good.” In response, mentors often shifted the conversation to a more asset-based approach that focused on positive aspects, “One of them wanted to make a box about recycling, not because the community is all that trash-conscious, but because it’s something he wanted to say he feels is important to making a community healthy.” By challenging a negative, dominant narrative and supporting curiosity, youth exposed personal stories about their communities.

The project was launched by the Maker Jawn Initiative across five Free Library branches in Philadelphia, and over 1,000 youth collaborated to create murals from foam boards, markers, and low-cost networking technologies. The murals function as programmable public displays that connect local neighborhoods with online audiences. Messages about love, family, hope, and questions about violence and social justice drawn with colored markers on the mural boxes by community youth are combined with digital messages sent to the boards from the Connected Messages [website](http://civicmediaproject.org/works/civic-media-project/connected.ecrafting.org).\n\n# The Youth’s Public Sphere\n\nYouth’s involvement with civic issues greatly differs from traditional political engagement or activism. Their citizenship involves tactics matched with their skills, motivated by individual interests and a willingness to participate in discussions connected with an audience to have an impact (Soep 2014). The public sphere for civic-minded youth can include social media sites, community spaces, libraries, or makerspaces; where there they connect to each other, find mentorship, and resources for engagement. Connected Messages experiments with new models of citizenship where youth build their own public sphere. Three tactics employed include: 1) Increasing youth visibility through creating interest-driven content; 2) Connecting youth with each other through technology to reach beyond immediate communities; 3) Integrating learning, making, and civic engagement to create lasting experiences.\n\n# Maker Culture, Civic Engagement, and Youth\n\nMany spaces in children’s museums, science centers, community organizations, and maker fairs organize activities in which youth making personally relevant designs such as robots, toys, and clothing. While such designs engage youth with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, they rarely offer community-relevant designs to explore the potential of collectively designed activities that can foster civic engagement. Murals, on the other hand, have a rich tradition of depicting local cultures and historical events through messages, images, and scenes built by individuals or groups who intend to preserve their communities’ spirit. They function as public displays and landmarks that transform individual efforts into collective designs and give communal identities to urban environments. Murals, however, are often conceived as static and permanent representations. They lack the dynamic nature of digital public displays such as media facades or site-specific permanent projections that can be programmed with interactive content. Digital public displays can capture the changing nature of communities and combine the capabilities of permanent displays with real-time participation. As temporary groups and collectives emerge to learn about each other through the social interaction in public places, the dynamic murals become social catalysts. It is within this larger landscape of interactive, participatory, and public displays that the community mural, called Connected Messages, combines the empowering nature of city murals with the dynamic qualities of digital displays.\n\n# Building Displays, Messages and Communities\n\n**_The project embraces a do-it-yourself approach towards digital mural design as youth build re-programmable, networked public displays from cheap and everyday materials._**\n\nThe displays are built pixel-by-pixel from cardboard boxes that include an LED and conductive traces. Participants use blank boxes and decorate them according to different themes with their drawings and writings. The boxes are then arranged on a grid and mounted onto foam boards. The board connects the boxes with each other and makes them individually addressable through a circuit controlled by a microcontroller. Through a wireless connection to the Internet, each board can receive messages from a website since a web user can turn on or off each box. The website features a virtual representation of the mural and web users can send animated messages to the physical murals located in different community locations.\n\n![Figure 1. Foam board with copper traces (upper left), Electric Imp and a modem (upper right), back of tile boxes with copper connectors (lower left), and tile boxes with designs on board (lower right).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_-gwzBXYgWVQZz9KYjdPNBA.png)\n\nThe Connected Messages murals were set up and designed during the summer of 2013 in five Free Library locations in underserved neighborhoods across North and West Philadelphia, communities that have been decimated by poverty (according to the 2011 census, 65.46% of households earning less than $25,000) and crime (584.66 cases of aggravated assault/100,000 people) with fewer than 2% of adults employed in professional, scientific, and technical services. Five Maker Mentors led the mural activities, a team that consisted of three men and two women ages 21–31, with backgrounds as working artists and undergraduate students.\n\n![Figure 2. Connected Messages website interface.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_NXjKO12Sh2lpOTvc2IQKOQ.png)\n\n![Figure 3. Connected Messages box reflecting on the Trayvon Martin trial.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_uAjEsAKq3wT8AEULViJdkw.png)\n\nOver 1,000 youth, between ages 6–19 years, participated in Connected Messages activities, their daily participation fluctuating from three to thirty participants. Youth and mentors at each location developed themes for their board around bravery, kindness, acceptance, and anti-bullying based on Lady Gaga’s Born Brave Bus Tour, which visited Philadelphia in March 2013. While all of the branches started from Lady Gaga tour themes, different branches personalized their murals according to the interests of their participants to give a true sense of ownership in the project. One library location — embedded within a nonprofit whose mission is to reduce the recidivism of adjudicated African-American youth — created boxes that addressed recent school closings versus new prison construction, their perspectives on the Trayvon Martin trial, and choosing positivity and creative outlets over perpetuating violence. All the completed display boards were gathered for a final celebratory event at the main branch of the Free Library. During the event, local makers from different branches witnessed the boards together, learned about the different topics discussed at each branch and leveraged the opportunity to interact with a larger online community within Philadelphia.\n\n# Reflections\n\nThe Maker Mentors encouraged youth to explore the project themes in self-directed ways that allowed for individualized levels of engagement. At the completion of Connected Messages, five Maker Mentors were interviewed about their experiences with supporting learning, production and expression of community voices, as well as their own learning. Several Mentors recalled that participants described their neighborhoods of North and West Philadelphia in a way that echoed census statistics on drug abuse, violence, and low education: “It was a bit sad to hear their initial responses of not safe, no good.” In response, mentors often shifted the conversation to a more asset-based approach that focused on positive aspects, “One of them wanted to make a box about recycling, not because the community is all that trash-conscious, but because it’s something he wanted to say he feels is important to making a community healthy.” By challenging a negative, dominant narrative and supporting curiosity, youth exposed personal stories about their communities. One mentor described that the process became organic, “I quickly learned that kid input and project driving needed to be a priority of mine… Informal exploration time allowed me to connect with my kids a bit more.” Another mentor outlined further ways in which youth could have benefitted from being involved in all design aspects of the mural, from making boxes to designing circuits:\n\n&gt; &gt; “Because it had so many components, you would have kids interested in each of those sides of it. You’d have the kids who were ready to have that conversation, and are ready to really talk about stuff, and then you’d have the kids who are just staring at the board and trying to understand the circuit, and they actually did. It was cool because you’d explain the circuit to one and you’d walk away and you’d be talking to other kids about the message itself, and then you’d turn around and see the one kid who you’d explained the circuit to sketching it out for his friend and explaining it, and that was always [illegible] but it was great to see.”\n\nThese expansions illustrate how Connected Messages can become a method for not only connecting youth to their community but also connecting them to making technology and civic engagement.\n\n# From Digital to Social Building Blocks\n\nAs an experiment in civic engagement, communities created personally meaningful designs reaching broader collective objectives, where personal voice was integral to the whole in Connected Messages. Youths created a collaborative display to discuss and share important, relevant community issues through Connected Messages. Project participants built relationships with others previously unknown to each other.

The participatory, intentionally non-hierarchical movement began with a teach-in. Concurrently, a Twitter hashtag came into use. The music video “Red Winter,” shared over Twitter, indicates how a fusion of contemporary and traditional music distributed horizontally through social media helped inspire participation in this international organizing effort.

Round dances, which have both ceremonial and social functions, create a circular form that indicates the equality of all participants, while their dynamic formation can also show struggle. In the context of the movement, round dances are used to build community, showing the commitment people have for each other. Beyond group dance, individual dancers show multiple traditions in “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEc3ZYqj5Fw&amp;feature=kp\">Red Winter</a>.” A hoop dancer and break dancer are juxtaposed, showing elements of urban and traditional culture coming together.

Through Twitter, this kind of networking extends beyond physical organizing. Social media platforms offer spaces in which individuals shape their public faces. Not limited to individual profile pages, opportunities to build collective identities online are facilitated through properties of the media (Evans-Cowley 2010). Twitter facilitates collective identity construction: users develop horizontal connections by following and being followed by others, employ hashtags to comment on a shared topic of interest, re-tweet posts, or tweet an image or song connected to a group cause. Combined ease of access and difficulty for central control make Twitter “practically ideal for a mass protest movement” (Grossman 2009). Anyone on a computer or mobile phone can become part of the crowd-sourced narrative. A National Day of Action was held on December 10 2012; there were 14,600 tweets about INM that day.** On January 11th 2013, INM held a Global Day of Action that included a gathering in Ottawa and sympathetic demonstrations across Canada and around the globe.

After this appearance, INM tweeted the video “Red Winter” once again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_9XFHBlTizhF8IbCsZY8u-A.png\" alt=\"Figure 8: 20 Aug, 2013\"></p>\n<p>The music video’s circulation required participation from many actors who tweeted links to the video, and after watching it online, left comments and shared it further. Beyond participants who acted in the filming of the music video, activists virtually passed the video on to friends and community members, attaching their own commentary while doing so. People who circulate a music video through social networks participate in the life of the song and help determine who hears its message. Online commentators interpret the music and, as evidenced online, the original artists and producers reply to these posts (This music video also had an offline life, playing for example in a film festival. While connections between online and offline organizing extend beyond the scope of this case study, it should be noted that the circulation of this online material had offline resonances).</p>\n<p>#IdleNoMore takes advantage of the aspiration-ally non-hierarchical nature of connectivity through Twitter. There is possibility for other grassroots use of online music sharing as any user with a mobile device and an Internet connection can become a newsmaker, even without the sanction of an official organization. Open access does come with risks. For Twitter to become an effective part of a larger grassroots strategy, it is important for participants know its limitations, including a potential for account hacking or the possibility that non-involved users might employ a popular hashtag to promote unrelated ideas or products. At its best, the circulation of music through Twitter allows diverse individuals to shape a public voicing of concerns. Through this dynamic process, ideas emerge and change in this sometimes messy but always participatory form. This networking logic that incorporates low barriers of entry and horizontal connections between participants allows musicians and other participants to share ideas, call for action, and offer time and skills for a shared cause.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Evans-Cowley, Jennifer S. 2010. “Planning in the Age of Facebook: The Role of Social Networking in Planning Processes.” <em>GeoJournal: Spatially Integrated Social Sciences and Humanities</em> 75 (5): 407–420.</p>\n<p>Full Duplex. 2013. <em>Idle No More at Six Months: Analysis of the First Six Months of the Idle No More Movement.</em> Ottawa: Full Duplex.</p>\n<p>Grossman, Lev. 2009. “Iran Protests: Twitter, the Medium of the Movement.” <em>Time</em>, June 17.</p>\n<p>Kurzman, Charles. 2012. “The Arab Spring: Ideals of the Iranian Green Movement, Methods of the Iranian Revolution.” <em>International Journal of Middle East Studies</em> 44: 162–165.</p>\n<p>Saccá, Elizabeth J. 2003. “Art, Native Voice, and Political Crisis,” <em>Visual Arts Research</em> 29 (57): 80–88.</p>\n<p>Simpson, Leanne. 2011. <em>Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back.</em> Winnipeg: Arbeiter Ring Pub.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

While connections between online and offline organizing extend beyond the scope of this case study, it should be noted that the circulation of this online material had offline resonances).\n\n#IdleNoMore takes advantage of the aspiration-ally non-hierarchical nature of connectivity through Twitter. There is possibility for other grassroots use of online music sharing as any user with a mobile device and an Internet connection can become a newsmaker, even without the sanction of an official organization. Open access does come with risks. For Twitter to become an effective part of a larger grassroots strategy, it is important for participants know its limitations, including a potential for account hacking or the possibility that non-involved users might employ a popular hashtag to promote unrelated ideas or products. At its best, the circulation of music through Twitter allows diverse individuals to shape a public voicing of concerns. Through this dynamic process, ideas emerge and change in this sometimes messy but always participatory form. This networking logic that incorporates low barriers of entry and horizontal connections between participants allows musicians and other participants to share ideas, call for action, and offer time and skills for a shared cause.\n\n# References\n\nEvans-Cowley, Jennifer S. 2010. “Planning in the Age of Facebook: The Role of Social Networking in Planning Processes.” _GeoJournal: Spatially Integrated Social Sciences and Humanities_ 75 (5): 407–420.\n\nFull Duplex. 2013. _Idle No More at Six Months: Analysis of the First Six Months of the Idle No More Movement._ Ottawa: Full Duplex.\n\nGrossman, Lev. 2009. “Iran Protests: Twitter, the Medium of the Movement.” _Time_, June 17.\n\nKurzman, Charles. 2012. “The Arab Spring: Ideals of the Iranian Green Movement, Methods of the Iranian Revolution.” _International Journal of Middle East Studies_ 44: 162–165.\n\nSaccá, Elizabeth J. 2003. “Art, Native Voice, and Political Crisis,” _Visual Arts Research_ 29 (57): 80–88.\n\nSimpson, Leanne. 2011. _Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back._ Winnipeg: Arbeiter Ring Pub.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

The campaign corresponded with a U.S. Supreme Court meeting to debate the issue. Shortly after, on March 30, Eytan Bashky (2013) from the Facebook data science team reported that “roughly 2.7 million (120%) more [users], updated their profile photo on Tuesday, March 26 compared to the previous Tuesday,” which was roughly attributed to the HRC push. The campaign to change Facebook profile pictures spread to become a global phenomenon. Variations on the HRC profile picture emerged, some in support of the campaign, others opposing it, and others critiquing the impact changing one’s profile picture can have. In this case study, we explore the campaign through the lens of the “actualizing citizen” (Miegel and Olsson 2007) and discourses around “slacktivism” (Christensen 2011).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_3eQ8uLaKLNdxlXzubzE_aQ.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 — Screen capture from the public HRC Facebook page, taken July 1, 2014\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"variations-on-a-meme\">Variations on a meme</h1>\n<p>After posting their call to action, a range of variations to the HRC’s image emerged, notably including several brands that sought to “hitch their wagon” to the campaign such as Maybelline, Absolut Vodka, and Bud Light (see fig. 2).

In the first example from fig. 3, a critique against assimilating into the heteronormative institution of marriage is mounted, inviting viewers (especially queer viewers) to re-think the value of marriage as an institution itself. In other words, “to extend the conformist embrace of marriage to same-sex couples is to lack imagination” (Jagose 2013). In the second example from fig. 3, the “specter of the slacktivist” is invoked, representing a pessimistic reading of the HRC’s movement as an effective form of civic participation and ridiculing the people who have “done [their] part” by simply changing their profile pictures.</p>\n<h1 id=\"defining-civic-participation\">Defining civic participation</h1>\n<p>How, then, can the effectiveness of forms of civic participation that play out online — as per the HRC case study — be measured? What actually constitutes civic participation? The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) uses the following definition:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>In measuring civic participation, we consider collective and individual activities that reflect interest and engagement with governance and democracy: for example, membership of civic organizations such as political parties and trade unions; serving on committees or clubs, voluntary organizations and associations; contacting members of parliament; participating in demonstrations and rallies; and attending community consultations.</em></p>\n<p>This definition silences informal modes of civic participation such as conversations that occur in everyday settings, in schools, pubs and over dinner tables. As per this case study, informal acts of civic participation are also mediated online, but rather than vanishing into the ether or human memory, as with physical conversations (that are not recorded), conversations mediated online leave “digital traces” (Bowker 2007), and this is a reality with which we are still coming to terms. The profile picture is one such digital trace. Recently, scholars have argued for a broader definition of civic participation. Christensen (2011) argues that even though we cannot effectively measure the impact of online political activities on traditional forms of civic participation (as per the ABS definition above, for instance) the activities of what he describes as “internet activists” can serve to “invigorate” and “reinforce” a broader sense of civic participation. Similarly, Vie (2014) argues that, “digital activism made possible through social media memes can build awareness of crucial issues, which can then lead to action.”</p>\n<p>In studying how young people engage in democracy online, Miegel and Olsson (2007, 231) consider a shift in conceptualizations of citizenship from what they describe (via Bennett 2007) as the “dutiful citizen” towards the “actualizing citizen.” Whereas voting and joining a political party are at the core of civic participation for the dutiful citizen (as per the ABS definition), the actualizing citizen participates in civic life differently, favoring loose networks of community action and “personally defined acts of participation” (Miegel and Olsson 2007, 231) over voting, rigid party-based politics, and other traditional, institutionally sanctioned forms of action.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>What constitutes civic participation is clearly changing, and the social web is part of this. As Harris, Wyn and Younes (2010, 27) argue, the social web can allow people a place to “have a say,” giving them a voice in an arena (civic life) that is otherwise dominated by people with power. Thus, perhaps changing a Facebook profile picture to support marriage equality can constitute a valid, generative and even ‘invigorating’ (Christensen 2011) form of civic engagement. Even though these performances of civic participation are mediated online, they should not be rendered less valuable, as somehow “not real.” Indeed, visibility (and the awareness that comes with being seen) does not just lead to action, but it is also a form of action in itself. While it is difficult to quantify the full outcome of this social media campaign for the HRC, even commandeered (fig. 3) or critical (fig. 4) reinterpretations of the pink-on-red equals sign contain important semiotic links back to the HRC, to the movement in support of marriage equality, and to the historic contexts in which the movement arose, elevating the campaign’s visibility. The figure of 2.7 million more U.S. users changing their profile pictures on March 26, compared with the previous Tuesday (Bashky 2013) is presumably only the tip of the iceberg here, as the meme continued to circulate in the days (and weeks) following, across the globe. Indeed, amongst our own networks in Australia, the original image is still set as the profile picture for some users. Viewers are engaged to consider these images by the prominence and importance of profile images on Facebook, potentially sparking discussion and reflection both on- and offline. Individual-centered, personally motivated forms of civic participation mediated online can represent an important part of a reconceptualization of civic life. By adjusting the lens through which civic participation is measured, a rich terrain of engagement will be made visible.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2010. “1370.0 — Measures of Australia’s Progress”, Democracy, Governance, and Citizenship.

Students created a 15-minute documentary, an original soundtrack and a social-media campaign called “More Than a Quota” examining the impact of Stop-&amp;-Frisk on NYC youth. Stop-&amp;-Frisk is a problematic policy in NYC that overwhelmingly impacts Black and Latino youth. Rather than being consumers of media, our students produced original content and distributed their message on global social-media platforms. Changemakers, our new-media leadership program creates movement entrepreneurs invested in leading conversations and shaping their realities.</p>\n<p>The “Changemakers” Program empowers youth to be producers and active participants in their lives, community and education. From political empowerment to social media movements, youth leaders develop their political voice, engage more directly affected young people, deepen public understanding and behave as decision-makers on issues that impact them directly. A Changemaker is an artist who can harness the power of New Media tools; bringing power back to the people in order to challenge the status quo through rhizome inspired networking while maximizing resources &amp; impact.</p>\n<h1 id=\"latinojustice-prldef-and-the-academy-at-urban-arts-partnership\">LatinoJustice PRLDEF and The Academy at Urban Arts Partnership</h1>\n<p>LatinoJustice PRLDEF (LJP) champions an equitable society. Using the power of the law together with education and advocacy, LJP protects opportunities for all Latinos to succeed in work and school, fulfill their dreams, and sustain their families and communities.</p>\n<p>LJP’s Youth Leadership Network is a program that empowers high school and college student leaders to engage in the fight for social justice and equality in their community through leadership, new media advocacy and grassroots organizing. Meanwhile, the Urban Arts Partnership (UAP) advances the intellectual, social and artistic development of underserved public school students through arts-integrated education programs to close the achievement gap.</p>\n<p>The Academy at UAP is a state-of-the-art facility that instills artistic, leadership, and academic excellence within high-school students, positioning them as agents of change in their communities and preparing them for their next step in life, be it college or career. The Academy is a program rooted in social-justice and designed as a third space — neither home nor school — where students participate in advanced art programs, leadership development trainings, and receive college and career resources and training. Through innovative arts programs, students learn and put into action 21st century skills to create positive change in their communities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"stop-and-frisk-a-broken-policy\">Stop-and-Frisk: A Broken Policy</h1>\n<p>New Yorkers were stopped by the NYPD over half a million times in 2012 and 5 million stops were made throughout the Bloomberg administration as a part of the controversial Stop-&amp; Frisk policy. 90% of those stopped were Black and Latinos between the ages of 14–24, 89% of those stopped were completely innocent, neither arrested nor issued a summons.</p>\n<p>Our youth have become producers of original media and have designed a social media campaign to capture and tell their stories. The HIVE NYC Learning Network , the MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning Initiative , supported this collaboration between organizations to create new learning pathways and innovative education practices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_XnUfGWozfUIvrL3FyAJsAg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"youth-participatory-politics-media-makers-movement-entrepreneurs\">Youth Participatory Politics: Media Makers, Movement Entrepreneurs</h1>\n<p>Social media is pervasive in the lives of American teens- to the extent that having a presence on a social network site is as synonymous with being online. 95% of all teens ages 12–17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are avid users of social media sites. It is well documented that youth are the least participatory demographic in terms of advancing public policy and often feel irrelevant to social discourse even when it involves them. This is exacerbated when the youth in question are students of color living in distressed communities.</p>\n<p>In 2012, LatinoJustice PRLDEF met with Communities United for Police Reform and asked how youth were included in the larger conversation of community policing. Rather than talking about the impact, we wanted to hear from those who had been direct victims of stop-and-frisk. We argued that given the opportunity, youth would expand their role as consumers of media to instead produce original content, curate it and distribute their message on global social media platforms to impact real change. We realized in order to make this a palpable and household conversation, the stories needed to come from the youth directly.</p>\n<p>Based on the campaign, as well as trainings from the New Organizing Institute , we developed a new media leadership curriculum to better tell the story of stop-and-frisk and New York City youth.</p>\n<p><strong>In the summer of 2012, Changemakers created a documentary and social media campaign examining the impact of Stop-and-Frisk. Students met with attorneys from LatinoJustice PRLDEF to understand the policy of Stop-and-Frisk and learned their rights about being stopped and frisked by NYPD.</strong></p>\n<p>Students also met with public figures, university professors, youth from youth-based organizations and community leaders to examine this policy. Academy students developed high level film and media skills through intensive instruction in pre-production, production, and post-production phases of filmmaking and digital strategy.</p>\n<p>On April 1st, 2013, Changemakers launched their “More Than A Quota” social media campaign, the same day they organized more than 100 youth in New York City to pack the courts during court proceedings. The goals of the campaign were to join the growing initiative to end “Stop-and-Frisk” policy, unite youth, pass the Community Safety Act, and to collect and share stories of youth who had been victims of stop-and-frisk policies. Additionally, Changemakers shared their documentary, led discussions around the city on current litigation and policy efforts, and conducted voter registration drives as well as “Know Your Rights” trainings.</p>\n<p>Through a collective and creative vision, students became 21st century agents of change and created a campaign that went viral. Students fused the power of advocacy, creativity, youth media and online activism on platforms they already use and master on a daily basis. We learned that as youth follow their interests, they acquire technical skills to gather information, present their own ideas and recognize the systems around them, which better equips them for their future. This campaign developed social, creative, and academic pathways that support youth in acquiring knowledge and mastering new media skills.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Changemakers have the power to transform the policies, practices and beliefs that entrench their communities. They have a vision of themselves in the world and understand their power as influencers and agents of change that utilize resources for tangible impacts.</p>\n<p>On August 2nd, 2013, in a win for civil rights, a federal judge ruled that the stop-and-frisk policy of the New York Police Department was unconstitutional and that a federal monitor would be assigned to oversee broad reforms.

Students created a 15-minute documentary, an original soundtrack and a social-media campaign called “More Than a Quota” examining the impact of Stop-&amp;-Frisk on NYC youth. Stop-&amp;-Frisk is a problematic policy in NYC that overwhelmingly impacts Black and Latino youth. Rather than being consumers of media, our students produced original content and distributed their message on global social-media platforms. Changemakers, our new-media leadership program creates movement entrepreneurs invested in leading conversations and shaping their realities.\n\nThe “Changemakers” Program empowers youth to be producers and active participants in their lives, community and education. From political empowerment to social media movements, youth leaders develop their political voice, engage more directly affected young people, deepen public understanding and behave as decision-makers on issues that impact them directly. A Changemaker is an artist who can harness the power of New Media tools; bringing power back to the people in order to challenge the status quo through rhizome inspired networking while maximizing resources &amp; impact.\n\n# LatinoJustice PRLDEF and The Academy at Urban Arts Partnership\n\nLatinoJustice PRLDEF (LJP) champions an equitable society. Using the power of the law together with education and advocacy, LJP protects opportunities for all Latinos to succeed in work and school, fulfill their dreams, and sustain their families and communities.\n\nLJP’s Youth Leadership Network is a program that empowers high school and college student leaders to engage in the fight for social justice and equality in their community through leadership, new media advocacy and grassroots organizing. Meanwhile, the Urban Arts Partnership (UAP) advances the intellectual, social and artistic development of underserved public school students through arts-integrated education programs to close the achievement gap.\n\nThe Academy at UAP is a state-of-the-art facility that instills artistic, leadership, and academic excellence within high-school students, positioning them as agents of change in their communities and preparing them for their next step in life, be it college or career. The Academy is a program rooted in social-justice and designed as a third space — neither home nor school — where students participate in advanced art programs, leadership development trainings, and receive college and career resources and training. Through innovative arts programs, students learn and put into action 21st century skills to create positive change in their communities.\n\n# Stop-and-Frisk: A Broken Policy\n\nNew Yorkers were stopped by the NYPD over half a million times in 2012 and 5 million stops were made throughout the Bloomberg administration as a part of the controversial Stop-&amp; Frisk policy. 90% of those stopped were Black and Latinos between the ages of 14–24, 89% of those stopped were completely innocent, neither arrested nor issued a summons.\n\nOur youth have become producers of original media and have designed a social media campaign to capture and tell their stories. The HIVE NYC Learning Network , the MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning Initiative , supported this collaboration between organizations to create new learning pathways and innovative education practices.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_XnUfGWozfUIvrL3FyAJsAg.png)\n\n# Youth Participatory Politics: Media Makers, Movement Entrepreneurs\n\nSocial media is pervasive in the lives of American teens- to the extent that having a presence on a social network site is as synonymous with being online. 95% of all teens ages 12–17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are avid users of social media sites. It is well documented that youth are the least participatory demographic in terms of advancing public policy and often feel irrelevant to social discourse even when it involves them. This is exacerbated when the youth in question are students of color living in distressed communities.\n\nIn 2012, LatinoJustice PRLDEF met with Communities United for Police Reform and asked how youth were included in the larger conversation of community policing. Rather than talking about the impact, we wanted to hear from those who had been direct victims of stop-and-frisk. We argued that given the opportunity, youth would expand their role as consumers of media to instead produce original content, curate it and distribute their message on global social media platforms to impact real change. We realized in order to make this a palpable and household conversation, the stories needed to come from the youth directly.\n\nBased on the campaign, as well as trainings from the New Organizing Institute , we developed a new media leadership curriculum to better tell the story of stop-and-frisk and New York City youth.\n\n**In the summer of 2012, Changemakers created a documentary and social media campaign examining the impact of Stop-and-Frisk. Students met with attorneys from LatinoJustice PRLDEF to understand the policy of Stop-and-Frisk and learned their rights about being stopped and frisked by NYPD.**\n\nStudents also met with public figures, university professors, youth from youth-based organizations and community leaders to examine this policy. Academy students developed high level film and media skills through intensive instruction in pre-production, production, and post-production phases of filmmaking and digital strategy.\n\nOn April 1st, 2013, Changemakers launched their “More Than A Quota” social media campaign, the same day they organized more than 100 youth in New York City to pack the courts during court proceedings. The goals of the campaign were to join the growing initiative to end “Stop-and-Frisk” policy, unite youth, pass the Community Safety Act, and to collect and share stories of youth who had been victims of stop-and-frisk policies. Additionally, Changemakers shared their documentary, led discussions around the city on current litigation and policy efforts, and conducted voter registration drives as well as “Know Your Rights” trainings.\n\nThrough a collective and creative vision, students became 21st century agents of change and created a campaign that went viral. Students fused the power of advocacy, creativity, youth media and online activism on platforms they already use and master on a daily basis. We learned that as youth follow their interests, they acquire technical skills to gather information, present their own ideas and recognize the systems around them, which better equips them for their future. This campaign developed social, creative, and academic pathways that support youth in acquiring knowledge and mastering new media skills.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nChangemakers have the power to transform the policies, practices and beliefs that entrench their communities. They have a vision of themselves in the world and understand their power as influencers and agents of change that utilize resources for tangible impacts.\n\nOn August 2nd, 2013, in a win for civil rights, a federal judge ruled that the stop-and-frisk policy of the New York Police Department was unconstitutional and that a federal monitor would be assigned to oversee broad reforms. The judge in the case, Shira A. Scheindlin, ruled that police officers had systematically stopped innocent people in the street without any objective reason to suspect them of wrongdoing. Additionally, on June 27, 2013, two of the Community Safety Act bills were passed by the City Council with veto-proof majorities.\n\nIn December 2013, students presented “More Than A Quota: Our Experience, Our Story,” a multimedia digital pop up exhibit at “SOHO ARTHOUSE”, to showcase creative responses to the experience of being stopped and frisked as a New York City youth. This digital showcase provided a venue for New York City youth to create original media and share multimedia projects that give students a voice in the discourse around community policing.\n\n# Digital Resources\n\n![Infographic](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_8GYS7fcfSnCiDiTpsQxalQ.jpeg)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/387691736_1280.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/55977221)\n\n[Nightline](http://abcnews.go.com/US/nypds-controversial-stop-frisk-policy-racial-profiling-proactive/story?id=19084229)- ABC News story.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

According to anti-trafficking experts, victims are rarely rescued through outside intervention but rather “self-rescue” when they have the opportunity and are prepared to take action (Morris 2012). Victims face many barriers in extricating themselves from captivity. Many victims don’t recognize their situations as trafficking, and may not know that they are entitled to legal protection. They may hail from countries with weak human rights protections, or may be culturally predisposed to distrust law enforcement and other government agencies. In some cases, victims may feel compromised, because of their immigration status or participation in illegal activity (including prostitution). Perhaps the most important barrier to self-rescue is the extreme surveillance and control that captors exert over victims. Victims’ movements are highly restricted, and their access to information and use of communications technologies are closely monitored.</p>\n<p>To be effective, rescue information must be provided in ways that escape their captors’ notice, address social and cultural issues that deter victims from seeking help, and mitigate significant lag times between when the information is encountered, and when a victim has the opportunity to act.</p>\n<h1 id=\"design\">Design</h1>\n<p>To develop an effective outreach tool, PPS designers employed a “surreptitious communications design” strategy.

Given the tight surveillance and restricted access to communications technologies that characterize victims’ lives, designers focused on ways of embedding information into everyday products that could be accessed by victims without raising captors’ suspicions. After an extensive review of potential artifacts, the design team focused on feminine hygiene products because the majority of victims are female, and because feminine hygiene practices often go unsupervised.

Human trafficking is most commonly associated with prostitution and sexual exploitation, but also occurs in a variety of industrial, agricultural, and domestic labor contexts. Although precise numbers are difficult to come by, there are an estimated 20.9 million victims globally, of which 75% are women and girls (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2012).\n\nHuman trafficking has emerged as a key global human rights issue. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\n\nmarked July 30, 2014 the first [“United Nations World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.”](http://www.unodc.org/endht) In the United States, President Obama has made human trafficking a top human rights priority, declaring “our fight against human trafficking is one of the great human rights causes of our time” (The White House 2012).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ofliPc16-NLq1zBzDbgWHQ.png)\n\nThere have been numerous print, broadcast, and social media campaigns to raise awareness of human trafficking and solicit donations for anti-trafficking groups (see for example, the United Nations’ [“Blue Heart”](http://www.unodc.org/blueheart) and New York City’s [“Let’s End Human Trafficking”](http://www.nyc.gov/html/endht/html/home/home.shtml) campaigns). The Pivot project complements these efforts, but focuses on direct intervention by outreach workers and civic organizations.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_zTZoPXwvDcY99TcM_qdLwQ.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_exzBWcLdvXX2JlBjK7pTtQ.png)\n\n# Stakeholders\n\nPivot was developed by the Public Practice Studio, a multi-disciplinary design and research studio at the University of Washington. Students and faculty worked closely with the [Washington Anti-Trafficking Network (WARN)](http://www.warn-trafficking.org), a network of organizations across Washington State that advocate against human trafficking and provide direct relief to victims. WARN serves all victims of human trafficking regardless of age, country of origin, legal status in the United States, or industry in which the trafficking occurred. WARN provides clients with free, confidential access to a variety of critical services including medical and mental health treatment, immigration and legal assistance, interpretation services, and access to safe housing, food and clothing.\n\nWARN has developed a robust organizational and communications infrastructure that enables the network to provide critical services to victims anywhere across Washington State, usually within 24 hours.

Yet the educational system is not preparing young people with the skills they need to participate in a data-rich society. Few young people — indeed, few adults — have interacted with data, let alone feel empowered in their interactions. This knowledge deficit presents an important opportunity to shift the dialogue about data through youth education. Teaching young people to work with data, and to become “data literate,” can enable them to understand and participate in civic issues, prepare them for a range of professions, and equip them to think critically and ethically about data.</p>\n<p>The City Digits project seeks to take advantage of this opportunity by integrating data literacy and civic education into the school curriculum, using digital tools and a student-driven pedagogical approach. It is a high school math class and an accompanying web application (citydigits.mit.edu) that provide opportunities for youth to explore data, develop data literacy, and engage in analysis and debate around civic issues. The first module, Local Lotto, focuses on the topic of the New York State Lottery and its social impact on New York City’s underserved communities.</p>\n<p>The project was developed by an interdisciplinary team: math education researchers from Brooklyn College, civic technology designers and urban planners from MIT’s Civic Data Design Lab, and public policy educators from the Center for Urban Pedagogy, a not-for-profit education and advocacy organization (National Science Foundation). The team worked closely with high school math teachers from New York City public schools, who gave feedback throughout the process and piloted the curriculum in their classes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>City Digits was designed to be implemented in New York City high schools in low-income areas, where mathematics scores are persistently low and students have few opportunities to participate in civic issues in or out of school.</em></strong></p>\n<p>City Digits addresses this disparity by grounding mathematics concepts in authentic data and real-world issues — making them more relevant and engaging, and encouraging students to take an active role in exploring issues affecting their communities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"piloting-city-digits\">Piloting City Digits</h1>\n<p>The curriculum was piloted twice in 2013 with 100 high school juniors and seniors at a public school in one of Brooklyn’s poorest neighborhoods. The first implementation was in April 2013 within an “advisory” class of 15 high school sophomores. The curriculum and technology were revised based on the results of the pilot and a larger pilot was conducted in November 2013 with one teacher and his four 12th-grade mathematics classes totaling 95 high school seniors (Williams 2014).</p>\n<p>The curriculum was divided into three units, each of which was supported by the web application. First, students divided into small teams to collect local qualitative data about their community’s opinions on the lottery by conducting interviews with pedestrians and lottery ticket retailers in their neighborhood, using the web application on tablets (Fig. 1). Students wanted to find out why and how often people played the lottery and see how local businesses thought the lottery was impacting the neighborhood. Using the tablet allowed students to easily navigate, collect data in the field, and instantly publish geo-located results. Students discovered many stories from people for whom the lottery is a central part of their lives. For instance, one man said he spends $50 on the lottery every week because is unemployed and wants to support his family (Fig. 2).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_wLdIh7hBydYZ5s5JGTJRAg.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1.

The map showed lottery spending and winning data at a citywide level and at a highly localized level, visualizing data from stores that sell lottery tickets. The map also shows lottery spending as a percentage of each neighborhood’s median household income. The geographic representation enabled students to identify patterns and analyze the large-scale effects of the lottery as a system, by building on geographic knowledge they already had about their city. For example, students quickly picked up on one of the most striking trends, that lottery players in low-income neighborhoods spend a significantly higher proportion of their income on lottery tickets than players in higher-income neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>In the final phase of the curriculum, students combined knowledge drawn from interview data and map data to assess the lottery’s social impact. In doing so they drew on the skills they developed and the information they collected during previous phases of the project. Students shared, debated, and published their opinions about the lottery, creating multimedia narratives to illustrate their reflections using maps, interviews, and other evidence to support and structure their arguments. They expressed a diverse range of opinions in their work. Some thought, “The lottery is a tax to manipulate and mislead the mathematically illiterate.” Others proposed a new system: “Each borough needs to have their own lottery, that way the money that is being spent gives back to their own community.” And some had the opposite opinion, that “The lottery is a great way to raise money for schools.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"challenges-and-outcomes\">Challenges and Outcomes</h1>\n<p>At the start of the program, many of the students were unable to read a map, a problem the researchers had not anticipated. In a pre-pilot focus group, they discovered that students did not have a sense of city geography, and that many could not locate the borough of Brooklyn on an unlabeled city map. Others had not mastered foundational mathematics skills on which the data analysis relied, and this caused some students to struggle with sections of the curriculum.</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, City Digits’ greatest successes were to support students in exploring a social justice issue through data and to engage students who did not normally participate in class. During the post-pilot focus group, the students told us they enjoyed the opportunity to explore data individually and in groups, rather than listening to a teacher lecture. One student said he had “never seen a class even work like this ever, ever before… Everyone was so interested. I didn’t think that was possible.” Students said that the class was engaging because the issues were “real” to them, and in contrast to typical school assignments, called on them to wrestle with complex arguments (Williams 2014).</p>\n<p>Exploring local data offered diverse opportunities for engagement, especially for English Language Learning students, who were not normally outgoing in class discussions.

Five of the students from the pilot volunteered to teach an abbreviated version of the class to groups of high school math teachers during the City Digits team’s training sessions. Most of these students were not the highest performers in their class during the pilot, yet they have gone on to master the content they are teaching and become articulate and enthusiastic presenters. The City Digits pilot showed that even students who were disengaged in a school setting were more than willing, when given the opportunity, to engage with complex issues facing their communities, and to actively participate in finding solutions.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

The City Digits pilot showed that even students who were disengaged in a school setting were more than willing, when given the opportunity, to engage with complex issues facing their communities, and to actively participate in finding solutions.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

Rushkoff (1997) describes tertiary students as needing to be “equipped to absorb the data flying across our screens, make sense of the post-linear grammar with which it is formatted, and participate in its production as amateur journalists.” Higher education (HE) institutions should, by implication, be digitally inclusive.</p>\n<p>South Africa’s struggle in the digital inclusion arena is undeniably linked to inequalities of access to digital literacy education resulting from years of societal division under Apartheid (Balfour &amp; Kajee 2011). This unequal reality is particularly problematic within HE, where digital technologies are increasingly becoming a feature (Balfour &amp; Kajee 2011).</p>\n<p>Within this context, an Alternate Reality Game (ARG)-based student induction program was designed at the University of the Western Cape to enhance student engagement and digital inclusion (“UWC Homepage” 2014). ARG presented itself as a potential solution, as it could include all students regardless of the student’s digital capacity in what Suits (1977) refer to as the<em>“temporary reallocation to autotelic activities of resources primarily committed to instrumental purposes.”</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h1>\n<p>The purpose of this project was to increase student engagement using ARG and localized memes, while increasing higher education institutions’ level of digital inclusion. ARG has been used in HE to increase student engagement (Piatt 2009; Whitton 2009a). Literature also provides examples where memes were used as engagement devices (Börzsei 2013). Numerous university meme pages exist on social media sites such as Facebook (Börzsei 2013).</p>\n<p>Memes, as “units of cultural transmission,” were first conceptualized by Dawkins (2006). Davison (2012) defines an internet meme as follows: “An Internet meme is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission.”</p>\n<p>The common usage of a “meme” was criticized by Jenkins et al. (2013), who questions the concept of deterministic “self-replicating” culture and the negating of the agency role of greater public control over content that spreads through culture (Jenkins 2014). This study asks the question whether deliberate meme creation may offer value in HE.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_7gIMQyllbH3pd9rE-Mh1Jg.png\" alt=\"Aliens on Campus\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"the-game-design-and-approach\">The Game [Design and approach]</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ng13gE3MDxKjHw87OeiXXg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ng13gE3MDxKjHw87OeiXXg.png\" alt=\"Aliens on Campus Logo\"></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Uwcsightings/videos\">multi-channel communication strategy</a> was designed with our target group’s diversity in mind and utilized text messaging, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), mass e-mail, as well as social media channels (Facebook; Twitter; Google Plus and YouTube).</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Uwcsightings/videos\">multi-channel communication strategy</a> was designed with our target group’s diversity in mind and utilized text messaging, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), mass e-mail, as well as social media channels (Facebook; Twitter; Google Plus and YouTube).</p>\n<p>Storyline: Confucius is the leader of the alien craft from planet ConfusX-12 that crash-landed at UWC. Remixed videos and images were teased onto a website and social media channels (“UWC Sightings Homepage” 2014). The League of Deconfusers is a secret society receiving telepathic messages from Confucius via social media, and they are actively recruiting UWC students to join the League. Senior students were recruited as Deconfusers, issued with branded t-shirts and given short training.</p>\n<p>Confucius’ nemesis is the <em>“Doom of Not Knowing”</em> (The DONK) and attacks people not connected and linked. The DONK was spotted at various places on campus and captured onto remixed videos which were placed onto the various web properties created for the campaign.</p>\n<p>Players moved through the game by collecting clues, answering questions, uploading media (video; images; text), entering codes left at particular places at particular times and using particular social media hashtags. The campaign aimed to create opportunities for ideas to evolve through deliberative dialogue, thus creating meaningful inefficiencies (Gordon 2012).</p>\n<h1 id=\"findings\">Findings</h1>\n<p>Lessons learnt from this pilot case include (i) ARG showed potential as a communication tool in a context characterized by varying levels of digital literacy, (ii) leveraging [by means of remixing/repurposing] internet memes within ARGs in order to attract student attention within the attention-deficit economy, showed sufficient promise to continue investigating its utilization, (iii) social media was confirmed as popular communication tool (within ARG) for marketing and communication amongst students, (iv) the use of existing online memes as engagement catalysts had a positive impact on student engagement within the ARG-enriched induction program, and (v) time constraints (only 5 days of gameplay) impacted negatively on the project team’s capacity to create sufficient scaffolding to ensure ease of mastery and more efficient adoption of the game by the target group.</p>\n<p>The true ARG aesthetic may not be optimal within educational applications. As Whitton (2009b) states: <em>“In order to generate larger player numbers, ARGs need either a) ensure a larger initial sign- up from the target population or b) ensure a greater percentage of active players from those who do sign up. Ways in which to achieve both of these outcomes deserves further consideration and research.”</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"practical-implications\">Practical implications</h1>\n<p>Even within the very limited game play time, players and some other university stakeholders started remixing the memes utilized and even started creating and sharing their own memes. This corresponds with the experience of McGonical in other more well-known ARGs played out over much longer periods (McGonigal 2006).</p>\n<p>On the potential value of the remixing culture in developing cultural literacy Jenkins (2006) states,<em>“More and more literacy experts are recognizing that enacting, reciting, and appropriating elements from preexisting stories is a valuable and organic part of the process by which children develop cultural literacy.”</em></p>\n<p>The potential exists that the creation of meme-based ARG induction games can leverage the generativity of internet memes that “allows instant reaction and encourages virality, so people can comment on the most current issues, events and people, as well as find an audience” (Börzsei 2013).</p>\n<p>This is one of the ways in which the game did not succeed. There was a lack of sufficient opportunity to ensure that the many systems designed were truly responsive to player interactions as suggested by McGonigal (2006). Therefore it can be concluded that, although a meme-inspired ARG offers potential for enhancing student induction, it needs to play out over significantly longer time in order to derive maximum benefit, and it needs to be an integral part of the broader induction programs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"acknowledgements\">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>\n<p>Our sincere appreciation goes to the following students who co-created Aliens on Campus: Reuben Claasen, Chiunde Mwanza, Conal da Costa, Ziyaad Parker and Vuyiswa Nomlala.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Balfour, Robert John, and Leila Kajee. 2011. “Students’ Access to Digital Literacy at a South African University: Privilege and Marginalisation.” <em>Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies</em> 29 (2): 187–196.</p>\n<p>Börzsei, Linda K. 2013. “Makes a Meme Instead : A Concise History of Internet Memes.” <em>SelectedWorks</em> 7 (March): 1–29.</p>\n<p>Dawkins, Richard. 2006. <em>The Selfish Gene.</em> 30th anniv.

It is an independent group and a confessional whose aim is to promote and protect health as a fundamental human right. Currently, Anesvad is developing projects in 19 countries in the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>\n<p>In April 2012 Anesvad launched a project called <a href=\"http://www.alternativa13.com/\">Alternative 13 News</a> with the purpose of finding new ways to involve society in international cooperation projects. This involvement would go beyond the traditional financial contribution and would aim at testing new communication strategies in the area of ​​cooperative work (Herranz 2014, 7) — such as exploring the use of new technologies and social media in this way; and looking for new means of communication to reach young people. This project was part of <a href=\"http://www.conexionesimprobables.es/pagina.php?id_p=358&amp;i=cas\">“Conexiones Improbables,”</a> a platform where Anesvad opened and showcased its projects to citizens and organizations.</p>\n<p>Alternative 13 News was an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that lasted for 3 weeks. It consisted of a news site that collected information feature reports related to the right to health. Fictional news items were projected into the future, the year 2013; and the objective for the players was go to through the situation of being deprived of the right to health. This piece of fictional news allowed them to experience the reality that millions of people living in developing countries go through every day. To increase its plausibility, the game started with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzeaU9TdQWM\">fiction video news</a> conducted by popular journalists.</p>\n<p>Players enrolled in the Alternative 13 News platform had to stand up for several types of challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Challenges to act and defend their rights; such as signing a petition to remind the government that it must respect international conventions including the right to health.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Challenges to become journalist and write stories (e.g. the resale of drugs in a neighborhood in the city of Barcelona; how the city of Santander suffered an infections due to the lack of drinking water).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Challenges to investigate and search for information, (e.g. finding a cartoon in the news that had to do with the current health news). Participants were rewarded with points as they met with their challenges.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There were collaborative challenges where players had to join others to solve a series of riddles in order to uncover a hidden plot (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.alternativa13.com/node/322\">Who Killed the Judge B.

It is an independent group and a confessional whose aim is to promote and protect health as a fundamental human right. Currently, Anesvad is developing projects in 19 countries in the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nIn April 2012 Anesvad launched a project called [Alternative 13 News](http://www.alternativa13.com/) with the purpose of finding new ways to involve society in international cooperation projects. This involvement would go beyond the traditional financial contribution and would aim at testing new communication strategies in the area of ​​cooperative work (Herranz 2014, 7) — such as exploring the use of new technologies and social media in this way; and looking for new means of communication to reach young people. This project was part of [“Conexiones Improbables,”](http://www.conexionesimprobables.es/pagina.php?id_p=358&amp;i=cas) a platform where Anesvad opened and showcased its projects to citizens and organizations.\n\nAlternative 13 News was an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that lasted for 3 weeks. It consisted of a news site that collected information feature reports related to the right to health. Fictional news items were projected into the future, the year 2013; and the objective for the players was go to through the situation of being deprived of the right to health. This piece of fictional news allowed them to experience the reality that millions of people living in developing countries go through every day. To increase its plausibility, the game started with [fiction video news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzeaU9TdQWM) conducted by popular journalists.\n\nPlayers enrolled in the Alternative 13 News platform had to stand up for several types of challenges:\n\n1. Challenges to act and defend their rights; such as signing a petition to remind the government that it must respect international conventions including the right to health.\n\n1. Challenges to become journalist and write stories (e.g. the resale of drugs in a neighborhood in the city of Barcelona; how the city of Santander suffered an infections due to the lack of drinking water).\n\n1. Challenges to investigate and search for information, (e.g. finding a cartoon in the news that had to do with the current health news). Participants were rewarded with points as they met with their challenges.\n\nThere were collaborative challenges where players had to join others to solve a series of riddles in order to uncover a hidden plot (e.g. [Who Killed the Judge B. Perez?](http://www.alternativa13.com/node/322); [Where is Sara Beramendi?](http://www.alternativa13.com/node/504)). They also faced some dilemmas and challenges in the form of collective decision-making, which was resolved by a vote by all participants.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_KjAiI9otMcWmg0GVqPX20g.png)\n\nSocial organizations and NGOs are increasing social media use to reach citizens (Guo and Saxton 2013; Waters et al 2009; Nah and Saxton 2013) and this project is a clear example of such development. During those three weeks, Alternative 13 used social media ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Alternativa_13), [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/alternativa13/pistas-de-alternativa-13/), [Youtube](http://www.alternativa13.com/node/535) to [Wordpress](http://diariodeunaestudiantevirtual.wordpress.com/) and [Blogger](http://damianreinosa.blogspot.com.es/) blogs) to make content more dynamic.

These workshops also allowed us to evaluate the technology’s usability and artistic potential, to fix bugs and to prioritize development features to make it more accessible.</p>\n<p>These activities have been encouraging civic engagement around sustainability issues, and have sparked a dialogue with diverse social actors regarding the balance between risk and potential entailed by the appropriation of surveillance technologies for artistic exploration, environmental monitoring and community action. During this process we have learned that in order to be effective, this technology has to support decentralized and voluntary participation, be low cost and easy to use by people without a high degree of technical skill. Our current work is focused on generalizing what we learned during this research into developing tools to facilitate development of low-cost, low-power, distributed community sensor networks for environmental monitoring and how this data could be used as raw material to design interactive experiences and eco-visualizations that can foster awareness and care for environmental resources.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Mendes, Mónica, Pedro Ângelo, and Nuno Correia. 2014. “Hug@ree: An ARTiVIS Experience for Sustainability.”<em>Leonardo</em> 47 (5) April (to appear). doi:10.1162/LEON_a_00822.</p>\n<p>Ângelo, Pedro, and Mónica Mendes. 2013. “Artivis Diy Forest Surveillance Kit.” In Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Electronic Arts.

We then set out to design and develop our own open-source hardware and software kit to simplify the deployment of video streaming nodes, and based it on readily available parts like the Raspberry Pi single board computer.\n\n![Prototype of the ARTiVIS surveillance kit showing the CPU module based on the Raspberry PI platform, using a USB HD camera as camera module, and a USB mini wifi adapter as network module.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_sX_bm3Crf83KjnDQV930Gg.png)\n\nThe kit’s development process included a series of community workshops where the participants learned how to assemble their own kits and explored the creative possibilities of real-time video streaming for use on their own projects (Ângelo 2013). These workshops also allowed us to evaluate the technology’s usability and artistic potential, to fix bugs and to prioritize development features to make it more accessible.\n\nThese activities have been encouraging civic engagement around sustainability issues, and have sparked a dialogue with diverse social actors regarding the balance between risk and potential entailed by the appropriation of surveillance technologies for artistic exploration, environmental monitoring and community action. During this process we have learned that in order to be effective, this technology has to support decentralized and voluntary participation, be low cost and easy to use by people without a high degree of technical skill. Our current work is focused on generalizing what we learned during this research into developing tools to facilitate development of low-cost, low-power, distributed community sensor networks for environmental monitoring and how this data could be used as raw material to design interactive experiences and eco-visualizations that can foster awareness and care for environmental resources.\n\n# References\n\nMendes, Mónica, Pedro Ângelo, and Nuno Correia. 2014. “Hug@ree: An ARTiVIS Experience for Sustainability.”_Leonardo_ 47 (5) April (to appear). doi:10.1162/LEON_a_00822.\n\nÂngelo, Pedro, and Mónica Mendes. 2013. “Artivis Diy Forest Surveillance Kit.” In Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Electronic Arts.

Citizens expressing their outrage over these electronically enhanced social networks spurred the government to implement creative and stringent policies in Beijing, including the prohibition of driving and construction on bad air quality days, the creation of a world-class yet affordable subway system, and heavy government investment in solar and wind power.

Those efforts have evolved and transformed from basic campfire lectures and artifact collections to paper brochures and wayside signs and, gradually, into audio tours and complementary social media sites (Mackintosh 1986; Bacher et al. 2011). The federal agency — the primary caretaker of more than 400 cherished places in the United States — acknowledged in a 2010 report that it now relies primarily on mediated forms of communication to share its messages, rather than ranger lectures and other modes of person-to-person interaction (Bacher et al. 2011). Follow-up analysis, though, also found that the pace of technological innovation throughout the agency had fallen behind the expectations of the general public. Unfulfilled potential remained for advancing historical research, improving interpretation, and increasing engagement with the public through new technologies (Whisnant et al. 2012). Our research team suspected that mobile media could help with this situation.</p>\n<p>So the agency created a partnership in 2009 with our team of scholarly researchers (from Washington State University, Texas Tech University, Portland State University, and University of Hawaii) as well as engaged practitioners and community volunteers in the Pacific Northwest. Together, we became focused upon the interpretation of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. For the past five years, the research team has been exploring interactive and interpretive interfaces at the site. Various grant-funded experiments were designed with mobile technologies to increase community engagement. Highlights of these award-winning efforts are reported here, but more details also are available via a behind-the-scenes blog of the project at <a href=\"http://www.fortvancouvermobile.net.\">www.fortvancouvermobile.net.</a></p>\n<p>In brief, the Fort Vancouver Mobile project has been guided by an action research framework and related methodologies that gather both qualitative and quantitative data through cycles of planning, action, observation and self-reflection. The techniques for this type of inquiry generally have been practical, cyclical, and problem-solving by nature, with the intention of generating change and improvement at a local level but also creating insights applicable to more global situations (Taylor, Wilkie and Baser 2006). Engagement can be approached and operationalized in many ways, but we chose to build upon Mersey, Malthouse and Calder’s (2010) definition of the term — as the collective experiences that people have with a media brand. The project worked with the National Park Service brand to focus upon these particular factors, related to interactivity: involvement (O’Brien and Toms 2008; O’Brien and Toms 2010), satisfaction (Patwardhan, Yang and Patwardhan 2011), and social facilitation (Mersey, Malthouse and Calder 2010).</p>\n<p>Those experiments and studies generally have been exploring research questions about the following:</p>\n<p>• The medium — Examining the mobile medium’s distinct relationships to media objects, audiences, authors, and society. One of the first experiments at Fort Vancouver was to observe the current media use and then compare that to interventions with other mediums. This process included watching site visitors explore The Village area, a remote historical location at the site, without any adjustments by researchers. That experience included access to two wayside signs and external-only viewing of two small, reconstructed houses. During the second phase of the experiment, the visitors also were given a standard brochure about The Village. In the third phase, they were given a prototype mobile app, and in the fourth phase, they were given an even more refined prototype of a mobile app, to observe how the experiences changed with the different mediums in place.</p>\n<p>Example: A Tweet-alogue –</p>\n<p>We had mountains of material — historic letters, diary entries, and book sections — about the real-life characters in our “Kanaka” narrative. That included back-and-forth exchanges between the story’s protagonist, William Kaulehelehe, a Hawaiian-born chaplain brought to Fort Vancouver to proselytize to fellow Sandwich Islanders, and the administrative and social leaders of the region. But much of that compelling discourse was buried in the minutiae of dense and dry procedural accounts from the era. To make the dialogue more accessible, and engaging, we took excerpts and added a touch of Twitterese, such as @ signs, and then put the pieces back together to form roughly comprehensible conversations.

The mobile device as a medium brings together in one delivery system most other media forms, such as audio, video, and text. One of the recurring experiments we conducted at the site was in-situ comparisons of roughly equivalent content in multiple media forms. That has included tests, for example, of audio content versus video content at the site of the oldest apple tree in Washington state. In these tests, either an audio or video clip first was randomly pushed to visitors at the site, via tablet computers handed out by research assistants.

That could include sharing material at the epicenter of some of the nation’s most sacred spaces. While erecting a large movie screen in the middle of the Gettysburg battlefield would be disrupting, to say the least, embedding a video for play on a mobile device in that same spot could be an extremely effective form of interpretation. In our Fort Vancouver Mobile research studies, for example, we have placed various media forms relaying the history of the Old Apple Tree, the matriarch of Washington state’s apple industry, at the base of the tree, so any passersby can access the material. In doing so, we began to wonder what media form would be ideal for such novel interpretation: audio with no visuals, video with captions only, video with sound and captions, or video with sound and no captions. The examples here show how we have tried to make comparable artifacts, with similar amounts of content for knowledge transfer, out of the different media forms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"interaction-design\">Interaction design</h1>\n<p>Studying mobile interaction activities, through audio / video production, discussion prompts, quizzes, physical tasks, etc. One of the overarching goals of the research team is to provide mobile media that prompts other mobile media. So when a video clip, for example, is given to a visitor at a particular site, the mobile app also asks for the user to thoughtfully participate in the history-building of the place, by making something in response to the original clip and to a specific thematic goal. Then, that user-generated content can be shared with other app users. For example, when the Fort Vancouver Mobile app shows a video clip of an archaeologist making an exciting find on location, the app simply asks, before revealing the answer, “What do you think he found?”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A8EK2wsNaX-RMq8GYr1HOg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Woy0wRj53HjwmoOu0ncQkw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_tKnCM7x3hTx07f-roCWRKg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A8EK2wsNaX-RMq8GYr1HOg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_dRBH1uWYqXupXuW9utvaXQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Kws4-XsNj_OVSjwcKDuxPw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_r6rS-KQlJ2wQN8IMYTzqrg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_r6rS-KQlJ2wQN8IMYTzqrg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_bRWk0jjLoldHG0kqR-m0HA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_rssvmN5Gl2w9UpWpby88cg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>*<em>Example: Embedded Photographs\n*</em>Similar to the mobile options now available for video, still photography also has emerging potential as an interactive, geolocated media form. In the Old Apple Tree case, mentioned above, we wondered what we could do with still photography that would somehow compel users to participate in the history-making process. With that goal, we bought the rights to a few of the local newspaper’s best images of the historic tree from the past century, added contextual text to those, and through GPS coordinates placed them at the base of the tree, so the Fort Vancouver Mobile app user would be able to compare the tree today with images of it from yesteryear. At the end of this sequence, cycled through via swiping, we asked users if they wanted to pose with the tree and take their own picture. This function turned the mobile camera on, and, when completed, allowed the user to share that image via social media channels. Many of the app users have chosen to take a picture with the tree, and these images have become a part of the fabric of the Old Apple Tree’s legacy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h1>\n<p>Experimentation with mobile-native compositional styles, including video reenactments embedded at the site of the historic event.

One of those experiments was this short video. We needed something in our interactive narrative that introduced our “Kanaka” protagonist, William Kaulehelehe, establishing his arrival at Fort Vancouver but also foreshadowing his troubles ahead. Traditionally, videos like these at historic sites are either lectures from rangers or Ken Burns-styled montages. Instead, we decided to tailor the video to the place where it will be watched, in the field, in front of one of the small reconstructed Village houses, and we chose to shoot it at that same location. We also designed the piece to be most comprehensible within the flow of the story, at the juxtaposition of the physical and the digital, meaning it needed the context of the place and the supporting narrative material to make the most sense. In those ways, this is a mobile-native work. It also connects the nearby Columbia River with the interpretation site. It offers subtle historical information, such as the way a gentleman of the era would be transferred from boat to land. It foreshadows the conflicting cultures of the place, as the native Hawaiian chant, about a new day dawning, transitions at the house doorway into a Christian doxology, and it raises the importance of coral to the Hawaiians, which ties into the archaeological backbone of the piece.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mobile-learning\">Mobile learning</h1>\n<p>Studying various factors of engagement, such as motivation, social facilitation, involvement, satisfaction, and knowledge transfer (both direct and tacit).

Those efforts have evolved and transformed from basic campfire lectures and artifact collections to paper brochures and wayside signs and, gradually, into audio tours and complementary social media sites (Mackintosh 1986; Bacher et al. 2011). The federal agency — the primary caretaker of more than 400 cherished places in the United States — acknowledged in a 2010 report that it now relies primarily on mediated forms of communication to share its messages, rather than ranger lectures and other modes of person-to-person interaction (Bacher et al. 2011). Follow-up analysis, though, also found that the pace of technological innovation throughout the agency had fallen behind the expectations of the general public. Unfulfilled potential remained for advancing historical research, improving interpretation, and increasing engagement with the public through new technologies (Whisnant et al. 2012). Our research team suspected that mobile media could help with this situation.\n\nSo the agency created a partnership in 2009 with our team of scholarly researchers (from Washington State University, Texas Tech University, Portland State University, and University of Hawaii) as well as engaged practitioners and community volunteers in the Pacific Northwest. Together, we became focused upon the interpretation of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. For the past five years, the research team has been exploring interactive and interpretive interfaces at the site. Various grant-funded experiments were designed with mobile technologies to increase community engagement. Highlights of these award-winning efforts are reported here, but more details also are available via a behind-the-scenes blog of the project at [www.fortvancouvermobile.net.](http://www.fortvancouvermobile.net.)\n\nIn brief, the Fort Vancouver Mobile project has been guided by an action research framework and related methodologies that gather both qualitative and quantitative data through cycles of planning, action, observation and self-reflection. The techniques for this type of inquiry generally have been practical, cyclical, and problem-solving by nature, with the intention of generating change and improvement at a local level but also creating insights applicable to more global situations (Taylor, Wilkie and Baser 2006). Engagement can be approached and operationalized in many ways, but we chose to build upon Mersey, Malthouse and Calder’s (2010) definition of the term — as the collective experiences that people have with a media brand. The project worked with the National Park Service brand to focus upon these particular factors, related to interactivity: involvement (O’Brien and Toms 2008; O’Brien and Toms 2010), satisfaction (Patwardhan, Yang and Patwardhan 2011), and social facilitation (Mersey, Malthouse and Calder 2010).\n\nThose experiments and studies generally have been exploring research questions about the following:\n\n• The medium — Examining the mobile medium’s distinct relationships to media objects, audiences, authors, and society. One of the first experiments at Fort Vancouver was to observe the current media use and then compare that to interventions with other mediums. This process included watching site visitors explore The Village area, a remote historical location at the site, without any adjustments by researchers. That experience included access to two wayside signs and external-only viewing of two small, reconstructed houses. During the second phase of the experiment, the visitors also were given a standard brochure about The Village. In the third phase, they were given a prototype mobile app, and in the fourth phase, they were given an even more refined prototype of a mobile app, to observe how the experiences changed with the different mediums in place.\n\nExample: A Tweet-alogue –\n\nWe had mountains of material — historic letters, diary entries, and book sections — about the real-life characters in our “Kanaka” narrative. That included back-and-forth exchanges between the story’s protagonist, William Kaulehelehe, a Hawaiian-born chaplain brought to Fort Vancouver to proselytize to fellow Sandwich Islanders, and the administrative and social leaders of the region. But much of that compelling discourse was buried in the minutiae of dense and dry procedural accounts from the era. To make the dialogue more accessible, and engaging, we took excerpts and added a touch of Twitterese, such as @ signs, and then put the pieces back together to form roughly comprehensible conversations. These strings of direct quotes, geolocated and embedded in locations that relate to the topics mentioned, can be animated together by users through a swiping motion.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_mK1LEFqNdJI4Wt1osayNLA.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_AZ2QC4BoO8dWza3UfBXBpQ.jpeg)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_2dJ-SwB_2oS2eO2VrxZy_w.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_SCGvOppv4wF_cm_uKpr-Tg.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_cAYJuuJun4dJeSY5cH8e5w.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_YsqK8S5YgGWoDLUx5RDEuQ.png)\n\n# Media forms\n\nComparing the effectiveness and efficiency of different media types (audio, video, text, animation) in various situations. The mobile device as a medium brings together in one delivery system most other media forms, such as audio, video, and text. One of the recurring experiments we conducted at the site was in-situ comparisons of roughly equivalent content in multiple media forms. That has included tests, for example, of audio content versus video content at the site of the oldest apple tree in Washington state. In these tests, either an audio or video clip first was randomly pushed to visitors at the site, via tablet computers handed out by research assistants. After hearing or viewing the clip, about the history of the tree, the visitor then was given a short survey about the experience.\n\n**Example: Audio versus Video Comparison**\nOld Apple Tree comparable 1 (no sound, with captions):\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OGvm7QRmCrA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGvm7QRmCrA&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nOld Apple Tree comparable 2 (sound and captions):\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zuLBJycvdU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zuLBJycvdU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nOld Apple Tree comparable 3 (sound, no captions):\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xU3DOWsV8cE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU3DOWsV8cE&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nOld Apple Tree comparable 4 (sound only, no video):\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VAgmiirinss/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAgmiirinss&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nMobile technologies allow, for the first time, easy access to video interpretations, such as historic reenactments, in virtually any field location. That could include sharing material at the epicenter of some of the nation’s most sacred spaces. While erecting a large movie screen in the middle of the Gettysburg battlefield would be disrupting, to say the least, embedding a video for play on a mobile device in that same spot could be an extremely effective form of interpretation.

Participants collectively respond to a series of questions in their preferred language using a web-based voting interface running on their phones or tablets At every question, UCoD builds real-time graphics based on the answers, and features them both on the phones and the displays. The performances, which range from thirty minutes to one-hour surveys, intend to capture the linguistic and socio-cultural profile of different communities in urban environments through visualizations and map the prejudices, assumptions, and biases present.</p>\n<h1 id=\"languages--cities--publics\">Languages — Cities — Publics</h1>\n<p>UCoD is designed as a data-sharing and visualization framework that supports real-time civic engagement among social groups and micro-communities. UCoD performances are made for cosmopolitan urban environments that are known for their rich and diverse public places. The events took place during festivals in Zaragoza (Spain), Linz (Austria), Istanbul (Turkey), and Marseilles (France), and were performed both as individual as well as synchronized performances in multiple cities (i.e. Marseilles-Istanbul) for connected experiences.</p>\n<p>As the performances intend to emphasize the linguistic diversity in public spaces, the questions are prepared in most languages spoken in these cities. While participants remain entirely anonymous both during and after the performances, they can pick their desired language and follow each other’s responses in the visualization through color-coded representations that correspond to available languages. And as identification with any language is voluntary, speakers of the same language across different countries can still identify with each other and form a public that can transcend the physical boundaries of public spaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gcr2njP4QxtW6lzTBsf4gA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"public-space--public-display--mobile-interface\">Public Space — Public Display — Mobile Interface</h1>\n<p>UCoD builds on the rich history of social catalysts designed for fostering interaction in public spaces. Here the performances take place within a hybrid domain that integrates the physical location of the public place, a shared public display, and mobile media where every participant can freely participate using a web-based interface.</p>\n<p>This hybrid public domain extends William Whyte’s notion of “triangulation,” which addresses the capacity of a public artifact (a sculpture, monument, fountain and so on) in facilitating interaction among strangers, passerby or those who have nothing in common but a shared interest with the public artifact (Whyte 1980). UCoD explores the agency of public data collection and visualization for soliciting such triangulation. By answering a series of questions side by side and witnessing each other’s answers in real-time, the public relates to one another through their similarities and differences in response to the survey’s queries.</p>\n<p>Regarding cultural prejudices and biases, UCoD is concerned with forming immediate opinions by asking participants questions that are designed to address both personal and communal matters. Based on a selection of topics such as the rise of right-wing politics in Europe, healthcare, social well being, education, immigration and environmental policies and so on, it prepares a list of inquiries that can solicit opinions from different groups of people. However, unlike traditional surveys, in which data is collected, represented, and mediated through different stages of interpretation and post-processing, real-time opinion forming relies on immediate interaction among the participants. Opinions are formed as people make selections, cast votes, and see each other’s answers. From personal matters to issues concerning kinship, religion, racial and cultural affiliation, participants witness how much difference every social group contains as they come together in an ad hoc manner while traversing public spaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_jQAC8L8JtvQGFKPaSPxpGg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gmhT9gr19NvXIE9Pc9HLGQ.png\" alt=\"UCoD visualization on eTOPIA media facade, Zaragoza, Spain 2014. (Photo: Orkan Telhan) UCoD technical schematic.\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"real-time-visualization\">Real-time Visualization</h1>\n<p>UCoD is a scalable real-time visualization framework. It is designed to run surveys that can capture the opinion of a single individual with the least common language in the crowd or collect input from thousands who participate from different countries, using mobile interfaces or websites. UCoD uses a data streaming network provided by PubNub.com that allows performance testing in multiple cities and connecting remote public spaces and audiences with each other for simultaneous performances.</p>\n<p>At the core of UCoD lies real-time data collection and visualization technologies that minimize the time it takes from soliciting questions to collecting answers and presenting results to all participants at the same time. When participants answer the questions using their mobile phones, they see themselves represented in the visualization as color-coded figures. As questions advance, they can track themselves on the public display and see the immediate impact of their decisions relative to other participants. The visualization animates and groups the figures based on how they align or differ from each other. These similarities and differences are based on a scale that plots figures determined by their votes, from positive to negative with intermediate values.</p>\n<p>Our efforts towards transparency and immediacy in the visualization intend to build a sense of trust in the platform that can be missing from traditional surveys or data collection frameworks. Census reports, for example, usually report findings after months of processing times. Infographics are designed to convey specific messages, and tend to construct data in favor of their intended arguments. Other real-time visualizations feature aggregate or filtered results where it becomes hard to see individual contributions or witness how opinions can evolve during the data collection process.</p>\n<p>UCoD’s technology also aims to foster a collective thinking process. While the identities of the participants are kept anonymous, the immediate nature of the visualization allows those who would like to share their opinions with each other to think and act together. Between every question, the participants are given enough time and feedback to answer questions together. We witness numerous cases in which participants voted after discussing their opinions with their friends or with a stranger standing next to them, hence experiencing “triangulation” in public space in person.</p>\n<h1 id=\"collective-critique-and-decision-making\">Collective Critique and Decision-making</h1>\n<p>How much our opinions align with others can shape our identities and communities in city life. Given its intentions to map out dissent, UCoD also seeks to find a new language to enable collective critique and agonistic modes of decision-making.</p>\n<p>Unlike following the format of public protests or forms of civic disobedience, UCoD intends to produce visual documents that can voice the critique of temporary publics with respect to specific, local issues. While remaining unknown to each other, community members can view each other’s point of view, collect opinions and use them as the basis of a critique against institutions and policy makers.</p>\n<p>UCoD works with local organizations to prepare questions that can bring awareness to disparate, under-recognized opinions while highlighting concerns spread from diverse groups.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; However, instead of voicing the interests of mass media, a homogenous collective, or a singular opinion group or minority, UCoD integrates the opinions of a heterogeneous public that simultaneously co-exists with each other. Thus collective critique, here, does not intend to become the response of the members of an exclusive group but rather stands for a collective document — a publication — that can be authored by a group of dissident voices who happen to be at the same place at the same time.</p>\n<p>As UCoD’s visualization maps on the basis of agreement and disagreement, it tries to build a ground of difference to work form. It promotes shared interests and common objectives while emphasizing the importance of differences that form the basis of diversity and discursive thinking in such temporary and provisional publics.</p>\n<p>Similarly, UCoD favors an agonistic model of decision-making with respect to the complexity of socio-cultural issues pertaining to contemporary urban culture (Mouffe 2000). Instead of promoting integrative policies that privilege specific social groups’ rights over others, it solicits interest towards a plurality; building a forum that can aggregate opinions. When the public is solicited to express their interests — for example to approve new interventions to the public space or to express opinions towards changes in policies and reforms — UCoD intends to function as a mediator, trying to re-introduce different publics to one another.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_P0zSjOZGt-1r1uzNO3BwdQ.png\" alt=\"UCoD mobile interface (Photo: Engin Gercek)\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Chantal Mouffe, <em>The Democratic Paradox</em>.

The performances, which range from thirty minutes to one-hour surveys, intend to capture the linguistic and socio-cultural profile of different communities in urban environments through visualizations and map the prejudices, assumptions, and biases present.\n\n# Languages — Cities — Publics\n\nUCoD is designed as a data-sharing and visualization framework that supports real-time civic engagement among social groups and micro-communities. UCoD performances are made for cosmopolitan urban environments that are known for their rich and diverse public places. The events took place during festivals in Zaragoza (Spain), Linz (Austria), Istanbul (Turkey), and Marseilles (France), and were performed both as individual as well as synchronized performances in multiple cities (i.e. Marseilles-Istanbul) for connected experiences.\n\nAs the performances intend to emphasize the linguistic diversity in public spaces, the questions are prepared in most languages spoken in these cities. While participants remain entirely anonymous both during and after the performances, they can pick their desired language and follow each other’s responses in the visualization through color-coded representations that correspond to available languages. And as identification with any language is voluntary, speakers of the same language across different countries can still identify with each other and form a public that can transcend the physical boundaries of public spaces.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gcr2njP4QxtW6lzTBsf4gA.png)\n\n# Public Space — Public Display — Mobile Interface\n\nUCoD builds on the rich history of social catalysts designed for fostering interaction in public spaces. Here the performances take place within a hybrid domain that integrates the physical location of the public place, a shared public display, and mobile media where every participant can freely participate using a web-based interface.\n\nThis hybrid public domain extends William Whyte’s notion of “triangulation,” which addresses the capacity of a public artifact (a sculpture, monument, fountain and so on) in facilitating interaction among strangers, passerby or those who have nothing in common but a shared interest with the public artifact (Whyte 1980). UCoD explores the agency of public data collection and visualization for soliciting such triangulation. By answering a series of questions side by side and witnessing each other’s answers in real-time, the public relates to one another through their similarities and differences in response to the survey’s queries.\n\nRegarding cultural prejudices and biases, UCoD is concerned with forming immediate opinions by asking participants questions that are designed to address both personal and communal matters. Based on a selection of topics such as the rise of right-wing politics in Europe, healthcare, social well being, education, immigration and environmental policies and so on, it prepares a list of inquiries that can solicit opinions from different groups of people. However, unlike traditional surveys, in which data is collected, represented, and mediated through different stages of interpretation and post-processing, real-time opinion forming relies on immediate interaction among the participants. Opinions are formed as people make selections, cast votes, and see each other’s answers. From personal matters to issues concerning kinship, religion, racial and cultural affiliation, participants witness how much difference every social group contains as they come together in an ad hoc manner while traversing public spaces.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_jQAC8L8JtvQGFKPaSPxpGg.png)\n\n![UCoD visualization on eTOPIA media facade, Zaragoza, Spain 2014. (Photo: Orkan Telhan) UCoD technical schematic.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gmhT9gr19NvXIE9Pc9HLGQ.png)\n\n# Real-time Visualization\n\nUCoD is a scalable real-time visualization framework. It is designed to run surveys that can capture the opinion of a single individual with the least common language in the crowd or collect input from thousands who participate from different countries, using mobile interfaces or websites. UCoD uses a data streaming network provided by PubNub.com that allows performance testing in multiple cities and connecting remote public spaces and audiences with each other for simultaneous performances.\n\nAt the core of UCoD lies real-time data collection and visualization technologies that minimize the time it takes from soliciting questions to collecting answers and presenting results to all participants at the same time. When participants answer the questions using their mobile phones, they see themselves represented in the visualization as color-coded figures. As questions advance, they can track themselves on the public display and see the immediate impact of their decisions relative to other participants. The visualization animates and groups the figures based on how they align or differ from each other. These similarities and differences are based on a scale that plots figures determined by their votes, from positive to negative with intermediate values.\n\nOur efforts towards transparency and immediacy in the visualization intend to build a sense of trust in the platform that can be missing from traditional surveys or data collection frameworks. Census reports, for example, usually report findings after months of processing times. Infographics are designed to convey specific messages, and tend to construct data in favor of their intended arguments. Other real-time visualizations feature aggregate or filtered results where it becomes hard to see individual contributions or witness how opinions can evolve during the data collection process.\n\nUCoD’s technology also aims to foster a collective thinking process. While the identities of the participants are kept anonymous, the immediate nature of the visualization allows those who would like to share their opinions with each other to think and act together. Between every question, the participants are given enough time and feedback to answer questions together. We witness numerous cases in which participants voted after discussing their opinions with their friends or with a stranger standing next to them, hence experiencing “triangulation” in public space in person.\n\n# Collective Critique and Decision-making\n\nHow much our opinions align with others can shape our identities and communities in city life. Given its intentions to map out dissent, UCoD also seeks to find a new language to enable collective critique and agonistic modes of decision-making.\n\nUnlike following the format of public protests or forms of civic disobedience, UCoD intends to produce visual documents that can voice the critique of temporary publics with respect to specific, local issues. While remaining unknown to each other, community members can view each other’s point of view, collect opinions and use them as the basis of a critique against institutions and policy makers.\n\nUCoD works with local organizations to prepare questions that can bring awareness to disparate, under-recognized opinions while highlighting concerns spread from diverse groups.\n\n&gt; &gt; However, instead of voicing the interests of mass media, a homogenous collective, or a singular opinion group or minority, UCoD integrates the opinions of a heterogeneous public that simultaneously co-exists with each other. Thus collective critique, here, does not intend to become the response of the members of an exclusive group but rather stands for a collective document — a publication — that can be authored by a group of dissident voices who happen to be at the same place at the same time.\n\nAs UCoD’s visualization maps on the basis of agreement and disagreement, it tries to build a ground of difference to work form. It promotes shared interests and common objectives while emphasizing the importance of differences that form the basis of diversity and discursive thinking in such temporary and provisional publics.\n\nSimilarly, UCoD favors an agonistic model of decision-making with respect to the complexity of socio-cultural issues pertaining to contemporary urban culture (Mouffe 2000). Instead of promoting integrative policies that privilege specific social groups’ rights over others, it solicits interest towards a plurality; building a forum that can aggregate opinions. When the public is solicited to express their interests — for example to approve new interventions to the public space or to express opinions towards changes in policies and reforms — UCoD intends to function as a mediator, trying to re-introduce different publics to one another.\n\n![UCoD mobile interface (Photo: Engin Gercek)](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_P0zSjOZGt-1r1uzNO3BwdQ.png)\n\n# References\n\nChantal Mouffe, _The Democratic Paradox_.

The central conceit is the term “Terra Incognita” which was used on maps in the Age of Discovery to denote unexplored territories. It’s a perspectival term. Because, of course, there were people like the Tupinambá actually living in those seemingly unexplored lands on Martin Waldseemüller’s map (above). The places the Tupinambá knew intimately — where they fished or hunted or celebrated or slept — were not <em>Terra Incognita</em> to them. But to the Europeans embarking on their voyages each new cove or settlement was a curve or mark to be made on a map, a way of demarcating the limits of their people’s understanding.

Even with these multiple sources of recommendations there were many blank spots in the recommendation system that we had to address. For example, China accounts for about 20% or 200 cities in Terra Incognita, but there was very little information in English about many medium-sized Chinese cities available through our recommendation channels. In this case, we worked with Chunhua Zhang, a media scholar from China, to manually compile a list of English-language news sources by city.</p>\n<h1 id=\"findings\">Findings</h1>\n<p>From May 2014 to July 2014 we ran a user study with 170 users that examined their global news browsing patterns prior to using Terra Incognita and after using Terra Incognita. We surveyed users about their transnational ties and attitudes towards global news, collected both qualitative and quantitative data and found some interesting results:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; While Terra Incognita did not shift the aggregate diversity of users’ reading it was a positive micro-learning and reflection experience for the majority of users.</p>\n<p>Though the app may not have shifted user behavior in aggregate, the vast majority of users (87.5%) say that they learned about a new place from Terra Incognita. Most users clicked at least 5 recommendations and 43% shared a recommendation that they found through Terra Incognita. Most of them (63%) think that Terra Incognita prompted them to reflect on the geography of their news reading. It broadened users’ horizons, piqued their curiosity and helped some feel “more connected” to unknown places. “It was a constant reminder that there’s a larger world than my screen.” (User 3)</p>\n<p><strong>Users with more transnational ties read more diverse geographic information.</strong> We surveyed users with the Transnationality Index developed by Mau, Mewes and Zimmerman which assesses people’s transnational social ties and personal experiences and found that for every 10% increase in an individual’s score on the index, the user showed a 2% increase in geographic diversity of reading (Mau, 2008). This is a finding that confirms an intuitive assumption (people with global experiences will read globally). This could be leveraged in future designs that combine online and offline transnational encounters as we discuss below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We offer several takeaways extrapolated from these findings that may inform the design of information diversity technologies. While the user study was originally conceived to examine behavior shift in reading patterns, Terra Incognita did not magically shift all users into reading more about Chelyabinsk, Hiroshima, Belo Horizonte and Abidjan. Moreover, it was unrealistic to have behavior change expectations for such a modest insertion into users’ daily information routine. What it did do is provide small, repeated opportunities for people to engage with unknown places. For many users, the value of the experience was in enlarging their sense of what they don’t know. “I found myself wondering about parts of the world (China!!) that I don’t usually think of in much depth” (User 47).</p>\n<p>So rather than starting with narrow, quantitatively-based metrics for success, it may be useful to see encounters with the unknown as a process that stretches from awareness to curiosity to engagement to aggregate behavior shift. Design goals and metrics may be devised for one or more of these stages and scaled appropriately to the scale of the intervention. In the case of Terra Incognita, by design a small and easily ignorable disruption, the tool was most effective at raising awareness of unknown places and at piquing the curiosity of users. There is more work to be done to explore exactly how best to achieve design goals at each of these stages and when is the opportune moment for introducing new information. Here we may look to the fields of Persuasive Technology and Public Relations for deep and possibly creepy sources of insight into media messages, technology and human behavior.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we see design implications for the finding that correlates an individual’s transnationality index with more diverse reading habits. This finding supports the common sense idea that people who have traveled abroad, lived abroad and/or have friends and family in far-flung locations read about more places. Given that an individual’s life experience and the spatial configuration of their loved ones matters so much to the geography of the media they consume (accounting for 16% of the variation in the geographic diversity of their reading), it seems wise to consider how to architect offline encounters as well as informational experiences. Face-to-face social encounters with geographic difference need not entail traveling to a foreign country. For example, <a href=\"http://conflictkitchen.org/\">Conflict Kitchen</a> invites hungry people in Pittsburgh, PA, to eat takeout food from places the US is in conflict with. Food wrappers are printed with first-person stories and interviews. WATCH CDC, a community development corporation in my hometown of Waltham, MA, hosts an annual event called “<a href=\"http://watchcdc.org/images/pdfs/breaking_barrier_flyer.pdf\">The Immigrant Experience</a>” that introduces the local community to new members through storytelling and potluck dinner. Combining information delivery with face-to-face social encounters that produce reasons to care and be curious about the world seems like a particularly fruitful next avenue of inquiry.</p>\n<h1 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h1>\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-incognita-1000-citi/hpiijgedgifmfegahhaaoamckbliijih?hl=en\">Terra Incognita: 1000 Cities of the World</a> from the Chrome Web Store.

For many users, the value of the experience was in enlarging their sense of what they don’t know. “I found myself wondering about parts of the world (China!!) that I don’t usually think of in much depth” (User 47).\n\nSo rather than starting with narrow, quantitatively-based metrics for success, it may be useful to see encounters with the unknown as a process that stretches from awareness to curiosity to engagement to aggregate behavior shift. Design goals and metrics may be devised for one or more of these stages and scaled appropriately to the scale of the intervention. In the case of Terra Incognita, by design a small and easily ignorable disruption, the tool was most effective at raising awareness of unknown places and at piquing the curiosity of users. There is more work to be done to explore exactly how best to achieve design goals at each of these stages and when is the opportune moment for introducing new information. Here we may look to the fields of Persuasive Technology and Public Relations for deep and possibly creepy sources of insight into media messages, technology and human behavior.\n\nAdditionally, we see design implications for the finding that correlates an individual’s transnationality index with more diverse reading habits. This finding supports the common sense idea that people who have traveled abroad, lived abroad and/or have friends and family in far-flung locations read about more places. Given that an individual’s life experience and the spatial configuration of their loved ones matters so much to the geography of the media they consume (accounting for 16% of the variation in the geographic diversity of their reading), it seems wise to consider how to architect offline encounters as well as informational experiences. Face-to-face social encounters with geographic difference need not entail traveling to a foreign country. For example, [Conflict Kitchen](http://conflictkitchen.org/) invites hungry people in Pittsburgh, PA, to eat takeout food from places the US is in conflict with. Food wrappers are printed with first-person stories and interviews. WATCH CDC, a community development corporation in my hometown of Waltham, MA, hosts an annual event called “[The Immigrant Experience](http://watchcdc.org/images/pdfs/breaking_barrier_flyer.pdf)” that introduces the local community to new members through storytelling and potluck dinner. Combining information delivery with face-to-face social encounters that produce reasons to care and be curious about the world seems like a particularly fruitful next avenue of inquiry.\n\n# Try it out\n\nDownload [Terra Incognita: 1000 Cities of the World](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-incognita-1000-citi/hpiijgedgifmfegahhaaoamckbliijih?hl=en) from the Chrome Web Store.

With stronger opportunities to connect learning experiences to specific locational contexts, geocaching in this program explored how youth engagement can extend into meaningful aspects of youth’s day-to-day lived experiences. Geocaching, then, highlights how exploration of the physical spaces around youth can instantiate civic lessons.

It is a nation-wide project that started in 2011 to collect, preserve, and provide access to Singapore’s culture and history. The portal aims to build a collection of national cultural content and make it available to wider global audiences for discovery and research. The project engages individuals, communities, groups, and institutions of Singapore to contribute their cultural content to the online portal to build “a culture of remembering, which will nurture bonding and rootedness” (“About us,” Singapore Memory Project, 2014).</p>\n<p>The Singapore Memory Portal allows online audiences to login using their online identities and upload text, photographs or videos to the platform. The portal has also an iPhone application that empowers users to dynamically capture and instantly upload memories (Elaine Ng 2011). Furthermore, the platform is designed to disseminate content through various social media channels — the ones most popular among Singaporeans. Since the project started in August 2011, more than 300,000 memories have been collected to preserve and provide access to the national culture, telling a true “Singapore Story” to the world (“About us,” Singapore Memory Project, 2014).These include “recollections of historical events, documentation of recent events of significance, as well as personal memories of people, places and activities that resonate with the Singapore psyche” (Elaine Ng 2011).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nQYyY7LWAJalSCtcBgELhQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The Singapore Memory Project is a timely online initiative that serves several political, economic, and cultural objectives of the country. Singapore is one of the best examples of national cultural rejuvenation, based on the principles of cultural diversity, actively utilized by the government for global promotion and nation branding. Building on the remarkable cultural diversity of Singaporeans who comprise the country’s three main ethnic groups — Chinese, Malays, and Indians — the Singapore strategy is to embrace new technology, creative economy and the heritage of tradition “to mix the East and the West…as a way of harnessing the region’s unique distinctiveness and promoting its renewed vitality”(Yue 2006). In this regard, in recent decades the Singapore government placed an increasing strategic emphasis on creating a sense of a new cultural identity and nationhood among Singaporeans, permanent residents and to some extent, foreigners in Singapore. The national cultural politics, dealing with an increasing level of multiculturalism within the national community, aims to utilize all available social communication tools, including social media, to construct a positive national cultural representation in the international arena and help people to acquire a feeling of belonging (Chong 2005, 560).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_U2cCLrFfzergFjn2aZavwA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_McT3FeLUKydiEiANvSHtmQ.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The image of the country communicated across borders as one that values minority cultures and builds new economy on the principles of cultural inclusion, helps the government to promote the country as a culturally and economically progressive society and expand economic opportunities by attracting external investments and developing tourism. “Singapore’s maturity as a city-state in the global context has also given rise to a critical need and urgency in ensuring that the Singapore story is collected and discovered to prevent the permanent loss of the nation’s heritage, national roots and nation development” (Foo, Tang, Judy Ng 2013). In this regard, the Singapore Memory Project online portal is an important activity on behalf of the Singaporean government in the framework of national and international strategic communication.

In this regard, the social media space of the Singapore Memory Project can be understood as a cultural public sphere, where representatives of various cultural communities and traditions can share their identity, contest their cultural voice, and get an access to the media tools for cultural self-representation. For example, though the dominant linguistic environment of the portal is English-speaking, the memory portal contains stories written in three other official languages of Singapore, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language%22%20%5Co%20%22Malay%20language\">Malay</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese%22%20%5Co%20%22Standard%20Chinese\">Mandarin</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language%22%20%5Co%20%22Tamil%20language\">Tamil</a>. This proves that the “memory” submissions, shared by the publics in the social media space of the portal, do refer to various cultural and linguistic traditions and help ordinary individuals to preserve and promote their cultures in a shared digital public space.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Singapore Memory platform employs the logic of the “strategic actions” (colonization) of the Singapore government to build through the online storage of memories a collective representational image of national cohesion, based on the principles of cultural unity.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The site serves as a life repository of cultural knowledge aiming to bring people from various cultural communities together in a shared activity of “remembering” that is supposed to evoke feelings of national pride and “a sense of place, community, belonging and opportunity.” (“The Report of the Arts and Culture Strategic Review,” 2013)</p>\n<p>By inviting ordinary citizens to construct their national memory narrative through their collective action, the portal shapes and defines public’s self-identification on a national level. Throughout the project development the National Library Board organized more than 30 “memory campaigns,” which aim to “tap into Singaporeans’ nostalgia for the past” (Foo, Tang, Judy Ng 2013) and, in this way, control the public effort in sharing their personal stories, memories, ideas, and values. Such campaigns as “Reflections on our National Pledge,” “A Tribute to Our Pioneer Generation,” “Hands that brought us up,” “The Singapore Story: My Heart, My Hope, My Home,” and many others have been widely promoted within the Singapore public spaces, such as libraries, malls or parks. Likewise, these campaigns have been increasingly marketed through various social media sites, for example Twitter or Facebook, actively encouraging online audiences to visit the Singapore Memory Portal for learning and sharing.

It is a nation-wide project that started in 2011 to collect, preserve, and provide access to Singapore’s culture and history. The portal aims to build a collection of national cultural content and make it available to wider global audiences for discovery and research. The project engages individuals, communities, groups, and institutions of Singapore to contribute their cultural content to the online portal to build “a culture of remembering, which will nurture bonding and rootedness” (“About us,” Singapore Memory Project, 2014).\n\nThe Singapore Memory Portal allows online audiences to login using their online identities and upload text, photographs or videos to the platform. The portal has also an iPhone application that empowers users to dynamically capture and instantly upload memories (Elaine Ng 2011). Furthermore, the platform is designed to disseminate content through various social media channels — the ones most popular among Singaporeans. Since the project started in August 2011, more than 300,000 memories have been collected to preserve and provide access to the national culture, telling a true “Singapore Story” to the world (“About us,” Singapore Memory Project, 2014).These include “recollections of historical events, documentation of recent events of significance, as well as personal memories of people, places and activities that resonate with the Singapore psyche” (Elaine Ng 2011).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nQYyY7LWAJalSCtcBgELhQ.jpeg)\n\nThe Singapore Memory Project is a timely online initiative that serves several political, economic, and cultural objectives of the country. Singapore is one of the best examples of national cultural rejuvenation, based on the principles of cultural diversity, actively utilized by the government for global promotion and nation branding. Building on the remarkable cultural diversity of Singaporeans who comprise the country’s three main ethnic groups — Chinese, Malays, and Indians — the Singapore strategy is to embrace new technology, creative economy and the heritage of tradition “to mix the East and the West…as a way of harnessing the region’s unique distinctiveness and promoting its renewed vitality”(Yue 2006). In this regard, in recent decades the Singapore government placed an increasing strategic emphasis on creating a sense of a new cultural identity and nationhood among Singaporeans, permanent residents and to some extent, foreigners in Singapore. The national cultural politics, dealing with an increasing level of multiculturalism within the national community, aims to utilize all available social communication tools, including social media, to construct a positive national cultural representation in the international arena and help people to acquire a feeling of belonging (Chong 2005, 560).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_U2cCLrFfzergFjn2aZavwA.jpeg)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_McT3FeLUKydiEiANvSHtmQ.jpeg)\n\nThe image of the country communicated across borders as one that values minority cultures and builds new economy on the principles of cultural inclusion, helps the government to promote the country as a culturally and economically progressive society and expand economic opportunities by attracting external investments and developing tourism. “Singapore’s maturity as a city-state in the global context has also given rise to a critical need and urgency in ensuring that the Singapore story is collected and discovered to prevent the permanent loss of the nation’s heritage, national roots and nation development” (Foo, Tang, Judy Ng 2013). In this regard, the Singapore Memory Project online portal is an important activity on behalf of the Singaporean government in the framework of national and international strategic communication. However, because it engages and heavily relies on the effort from the civil society and general population, the project has strong political and cultural implications on the level of public participation and involvement.\n\nIn the Western academic discourse on cultural policies, the Habermasian model of the public sphere (Habermas 1962) has been dominating the critical analysis as a main framework investigating various social and cultural movements within governmental agendas (McGuigan 1996).

In these regard, the contemporary design of cultural policy initiatives necessarily includes a “public deliberative” component based on constructing “demotic spaces dedicated to _representing_ a variety of experiences and modes of citizenship” (Message 2007).\n\nDrawing on the Habermas theory of public sphere and communicative action, it is possible to look at the Memory Project as an online social space representing two different communicative rationales, describing the social dimension of the online mass communication processes: strategic “colonization” and public “emancipation.” On the one hand, the “democratic” participative nature of the social media platform enacts the “communicative action of the life world” (emancipation), which contains ethical rationality, enabling participation of various social and cultural groups in “uncontrolled” media representation.

It describes how a father seeks justice in the courts after his daughter died of leukemia contracted at a Samsung semiconductor plant where unprotected workers were exposed to toxic chemicals. This film is the first one in Korean cinema history funded entirely by crowdfunding and individual investments. Its success was largely attributed to the key role of digital media in forming digital civic networks among ordinary citizens to gain support through funding, marketing, and distribution.</p>\n<p>To elucidate this virtually unprecedented digital civic activism in Korea, we can attend to Zuckerman’s two-dimensional matrix for the analytic framework, introduced in the web posting “<a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2013/03/26/beyond-the-crisis-in-civics-notes-from-my-2013-dml-talk\">Beyond the Crisis in Civics</a>”. One axis of the matrix shifts from “thin” to “thick” and the other from “symbolic” to “impactful.” On the first axis, “thin” activities include those of little commitment including signing a petition, clicking “like” on Facebook pages, or retweeting Twitter mentions. “Thick” activities require substantial commitment or action to find solutions such as developing organizing strategies for a political campaign. On the second axis, “symbolic” engagement includes activities of “making voice,” the purpose of which is showing support rather than making an immediate change. “Impactful” engagement, on the other hand, is directed towards concrete results like policy changes. Among the four possible combinations, “thin and symbolic” engagement seems applicable initially to the new civic culture created by digital media, but it also can potentially lead to thick and impactful influences. The transition from the former to the latter is not automatic, though, because thin and symbolic phenomena are likely to be volatile and in many situations remain in echo chambers. Regarding this flow in the matrix, what is interesting about _Another Promise_’s digital civic network in the Korean context is that it illustrates how a particular small voice leaped from “thin and symbolic” to “thick and impactful,” especially that change being made against Samsung, which is perceived in Korea as almost invulnerable.</p>\n<h1 id=\"phase-1-the-first-stage-of-crowdfunding-and-digital-flock\">Phase 1: The First Stage of Crowdfunding and “Digital Flock”</h1>\n<p>In June 2005, Yun-Mi Hwang, then a 20-year-old woman, was diagnosed with acute leukemia 20 months after beginning work at one of the Samsung semiconductor plants. She died in 2007. Her father, Sang-Ki Hwang, soon began a long legal battle against the world’s largest electronics company, with the intention of proving that his daughter’s death was caused by exposure to toxic chemicals at the plant. Yun-Mi was among the numerous victims beginning in the late 1990s whose deaths were allegedly from the same causes. Still, this event barely drew public attention; Samsung repeatedly denied that the work environment contributed to this fatal disease.</p>\n<p>A newspaper article about Yun-Mi’s case inspired the film director Tae-Yun Kim to bring this issue to the screen. Soon after, the best filmmaking staff and crews in Korea volunteered to undertake the project <em>pro bono</em>. The filmmaking team, however, faced an unexpected financial issue resulting from major commercial investors’ abrupt retraction of their investments. This action was presumably due to their reluctance to be involved in a film that was critical of Samsung. The only funding option left for the filmmakers was crowdfunding — originally intended solely for marketing use.</p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/52529436\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/362437186_1280.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a>\n<em>Video 1: The Teaser Trailer for Another Promise from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/goodfunding\">goodfunding</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a></em></p>\n<p>In November 2012, the filmmaking team launched a crowdfunding project using an online platform, <a href=\"http://goodfunding.net/\">Good Funding.</a> Within one month, about $100,000 was gathered from approximately 2,000 people. Ki-Ho Yoon, the film’s producer, said that crowdfunding contributors of the first stage were a group of people who were actively informed and critical of various social issues, and who were already aware of the Samsung workers’ occupational diseases. Attracting the attention of a “digital flock” beyond this small and informed group was a challenge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdqCztccUoE&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/CdqCztccUoE/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a>\n<em>Video 2: The Teaser Trailer for Another Promise at the Official Webpage</em></p>\n<p><em>Another Promise_’s filmmaking team initiated a strategic movement to avoid digital echo chambers. In January 2013, Yoon launched <a href=\"http://anotherfam.com/board/commentboard.php\">an official webpage</a> for a second crowdfunding effort called _The Filmmaking Co-Op</em>, as well launching <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anotherfamily\">a Facebook page</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anotherfam\">a Twitter account</a>. The team hired a media specialist to facilitate not only communication and advertising, but also fundraising.</p>\n<p>In February 2013, the filmmakers began to appear on well-known podcasting shows that critically examine controversial issues largely overlooked in the mainstream media. Nonetheless, these podcasting shows drew audiences who might have already participated in the first round of crowdfunding. Thus, these appearances were not as effective at developing support beyond the first “digital flock.” No connection had yet been made with the diverse public offline; promotion was still hovering around the second quadrant of “thin and symbolic.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"phase-ii-escaping-echo-chambers-and-creating-thick-and-impactful-changes\">Phase II: Escaping Echo Chambers and Creating Thick and Impactful Changes</h1>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/92019107\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/471600005_1280.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a>\n<em>Video 3: The Staff Slide for Another Promise, Posted on the Facebook Page</em></p>\n<p>A breakthrough took place in April 2013 when the filmmakers appeared on one particular podcast show hosted by a hip-hop musician. Most of the audience were young fans of the hip-hop musician and not necessarily socially active or informed. After this appearance, however, the filmmakers received dramatically increasing public attention. It is believed that once the film became connected with a new audience, interest in the film snowballed and news readily spread across varied networks at an increasing rate. Over the next two months, roughly 7,000 more people donated about $1 million in exchange for cinema tickets or DVDs. The effect is evident in the list of donors at the end of the film credits. Donations continued after official production and distribution ended; 8,290 people made contributions as of June 2014.</p>\n<p>All of this movement provided the funding needed for the production. More importantly, it succeeded in publicizing the issues that motivated the film’s story and helped form a strong and widespread digital civic network. Yoon made it clear that such dramatic attention — what we see as “thick and impactful change” — did not automatically follow the appearance on the podcast show in and of itself. The show certainly brought the filmmakers the new audience they needed, but the main reason for success was the narrative. Such a controversial topic, which most people did not think could be treated publicly in Korean society, had broad appeal.</p>\n<p>After production, the film successfully debuted in October 2013 at the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) under the title <em>Another Family</em> (this title is a famous slogan in Samsung’s commercials, yet it was altered to <em>Another Promise</em> before distribution to avoid potential legal action). Mainstream media, including television broadcasting as well as news and movie magazines, called attention to the film. It seemed that success, a tangible result of the film’s first substantial transition to “thick and impactful” change, was just around the corner.</p>\n<h1 id=\"phase-iii-unexpected-hindrance-crowd-distribution-and-new-participatory-culture\">Phase III: Unexpected Hindrance, Crowd-distribution, and New Participatory Culture</h1>\n<p><em>Another Promise</em> was ranked first for audience anticipation the week before its release. Prior to that, however, major film distributors drastically reduced, without prior notice, the number of theaters screening the film. Yoon felt powerless to respond and was about to give up. Then he saw ordinary people and NGOs that were already well-networked online and offline demanding that commercial film distributors and independent theaters in their own locales run the film. Social media (SNS and Twitter) and the <em>Another Promise</em> webpage became a central arena for this action once again. The crowdfunding system turned into crowd-<em>distribution</em> at that point. Through social media and the film’s webpage, people donated tickets to those who wanted to watch the movie but could not afford the ticket price (such as young students). Information was shared about screenings in their area, and supporting comments were posted about the film. In the fourth week of its release, more theaters began screening the film — a very unusual box-office pattern. In May 2014 — at the height of public attention to <em>Another Promise</em> sparked by such digital activism — Samsung made its first official apology to the workers who suffered through cancer and to their families. This was seven years after Hwang first initiated legal action.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Although the film barely broke even financially (500,000 people watched it, short of the original target of 700,000), Yoon did not see the film as a failure, but saw it as confirming the possibility of change and promoting civic solidarity.</p>\n<p>From the filmmaker’s perspective, the film was made by a civic network of 10,000 ordinary people, not just by the filmmaking team. Above all, without the Internet dramatically boosting the development of an active civic network, the film would not have come into existence at all. Yoon also stressed that the foundation of the film was in the long-standing offline activism surrounding Hwang (Yun-Mi’s father) and <em>Sharp</em> (a group organized by victims of the chip factories’ toxicity and their families). <em>Another Promise</em> was a tipping point for change, but the film would not have been nearly as successful without these earlier contributions.</p>\n<p>The film’s most notable triumph, among many others, was to break the stronghold of self-censorship and fear of Samsung’s influence. Indeed, what <em>Another</em> <em>Promise_’s digital civic network fought against was not Samsung _per se</em>. Rather, it was the fear of Samsung deeply entrenched in people’s minds in Korean society.* Another Promise*was not simply a film — it heralded a new phenomenon of digital activism and participatory culture in Korea, showing how thin and symbolic actions online can transform to a collective civic power that enables real change throughout society.</p>\n<p>This case study is based on an interview with Ki-Ho Yoon, a producer of Another Promise, conducted on June 6, 2014, as well as on the second author’s experience with <em>The Filmmaking Co-Op</em>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Colleoni, E., A.

Still, this event barely drew public attention; Samsung repeatedly denied that the work environment contributed to this fatal disease.\n\nA newspaper article about Yun-Mi’s case inspired the film director Tae-Yun Kim to bring this issue to the screen. Soon after, the best filmmaking staff and crews in Korea volunteered to undertake the project _pro bono_. The filmmaking team, however, faced an unexpected financial issue resulting from major commercial investors’ abrupt retraction of their investments. This action was presumably due to their reluctance to be involved in a film that was critical of Samsung. The only funding option left for the filmmakers was crowdfunding — originally intended solely for marketing use.\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/362437186_1280.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/52529436)\n_Video 1: The Teaser Trailer for Another Promise from [goodfunding](https://vimeo.com/goodfunding) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)_\n\nIn November 2012, the filmmaking team launched a crowdfunding project using an online platform, [Good Funding.](http://goodfunding.net/) Within one month, about $100,000 was gathered from approximately 2,000 people. Ki-Ho Yoon, the film’s producer, said that crowdfunding contributors of the first stage were a group of people who were actively informed and critical of various social issues, and who were already aware of the Samsung workers’ occupational diseases. Attracting the attention of a “digital flock” beyond this small and informed group was a challenge.\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CdqCztccUoE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdqCztccUoE&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n_Video 2: The Teaser Trailer for Another Promise at the Official Webpage_\n\n_Another Promise_’s filmmaking team initiated a strategic movement to avoid digital echo chambers. In January 2013, Yoon launched [an official webpage](http://anotherfam.com/board/commentboard.php) for a second crowdfunding effort called _The Filmmaking Co-Op_, as well launching [a Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/anotherfamily) and [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/anotherfam). The team hired a media specialist to facilitate not only communication and advertising, but also fundraising.\n\nIn February 2013, the filmmakers began to appear on well-known podcasting shows that critically examine controversial issues largely overlooked in the mainstream media. Nonetheless, these podcasting shows drew audiences who might have already participated in the first round of crowdfunding. Thus, these appearances were not as effective at developing support beyond the first “digital flock.” No connection had yet been made with the diverse public offline; promotion was still hovering around the second quadrant of “thin and symbolic.”\n\n# Phase II: Escaping Echo Chambers and Creating Thick and Impactful Changes\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/471600005_1280.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/92019107)\n_Video 3: The Staff Slide for Another Promise, Posted on the Facebook Page_\n\nA breakthrough took place in April 2013 when the filmmakers appeared on one particular podcast show hosted by a hip-hop musician. Most of the audience were young fans of the hip-hop musician and not necessarily socially active or informed. After this appearance, however, the filmmakers received dramatically increasing public attention. It is believed that once the film became connected with a new audience, interest in the film snowballed and news readily spread across varied networks at an increasing rate. Over the next two months, roughly 7,000 more people donated about $1 million in exchange for cinema tickets or DVDs. The effect is evident in the list of donors at the end of the film credits. Donations continued after official production and distribution ended; 8,290 people made contributions as of June 2014.\n\nAll of this movement provided the funding needed for the production. More importantly, it succeeded in publicizing the issues that motivated the film’s story and helped form a strong and widespread digital civic network. Yoon made it clear that such dramatic attention — what we see as “thick and impactful change” — did not automatically follow the appearance on the podcast show in and of itself. The show certainly brought the filmmakers the new audience they needed, but the main reason for success was the narrative. Such a controversial topic, which most people did not think could be treated publicly in Korean society, had broad appeal.\n\nAfter production, the film successfully debuted in October 2013 at the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) under the title _Another Family_ (this title is a famous slogan in Samsung’s commercials, yet it was altered to _Another Promise_ before distribution to avoid potential legal action). Mainstream media, including television broadcasting as well as news and movie magazines, called attention to the film. It seemed that success, a tangible result of the film’s first substantial transition to “thick and impactful” change, was just around the corner.\n\n# Phase III: Unexpected Hindrance, Crowd-distribution, and New Participatory Culture\n\n_Another Promise_ was ranked first for audience anticipation the week before its release. Prior to that, however, major film distributors drastically reduced, without prior notice, the number of theaters screening the film. Yoon felt powerless to respond and was about to give up. Then he saw ordinary people and NGOs that were already well-networked online and offline demanding that commercial film distributors and independent theaters in their own locales run the film. Social media (SNS and Twitter) and the _Another Promise_ webpage became a central arena for this action once again. The crowdfunding system turned into crowd-_distribution_ at that point. Through social media and the film’s webpage, people donated tickets to those who wanted to watch the movie but could not afford the ticket price (such as young students). Information was shared about screenings in their area, and supporting comments were posted about the film. In the fourth week of its release, more theaters began screening the film — a very unusual box-office pattern. In May 2014 — at the height of public attention to _Another Promise_ sparked by such digital activism — Samsung made its first official apology to the workers who suffered through cancer and to their families. This was seven years after Hwang first initiated legal action.\n\n&gt; &gt; Although the film barely broke even financially (500,000 people watched it, short of the original target of 700,000), Yoon did not see the film as a failure, but saw it as confirming the possibility of change and promoting civic solidarity.\n\nFrom the filmmaker’s perspective, the film was made by a civic network of 10,000 ordinary people, not just by the filmmaking team. Above all, without the Internet dramatically boosting the development of an active civic network, the film would not have come into existence at all. Yoon also stressed that the foundation of the film was in the long-standing offline activism surrounding Hwang (Yun-Mi’s father) and _Sharp_ (a group organized by victims of the chip factories’ toxicity and their families). _Another Promise_ was a tipping point for change, but the film would not have been nearly as successful without these earlier contributions.\n\nThe film’s most notable triumph, among many others, was to break the stronghold of self-censorship and fear of Samsung’s influence. Indeed, what _Another_ _Promise_’s digital civic network fought against was not Samsung _per se_. Rather, it was the fear of Samsung deeply entrenched in people’s minds in Korean society.* Another Promise*was not simply a film — it heralded a new phenomenon of digital activism and participatory culture in Korea, showing how thin and symbolic actions online can transform to a collective civic power that enables real change throughout society.\n\nThis case study is based on an interview with Ki-Ho Yoon, a producer of Another Promise, conducted on June 6, 2014, as well as on the second author’s experience with _The Filmmaking Co-Op_.\n\n# References\n\nColleoni, E., A.

Despite this, the number of blogs on and from Cuba have raised over the past years. On November, 2007 there were 156 blogs on Cuba; six years later, this reached the number of 1239 blogs. Blogs are considered an effective way for political participation that has altered political communication (Woodly 2014). In a context where all the media are state-owned, this role has some particularities: blogs could open a significant opportunity for citizens to have a space of expression, qualified as “<a href=\"http://quovadiscuba.wordpress.com/\">doors open to controversy and debate</a>,” by an official Cuban journalist and blogger.</p>\n<p>There are three trends in the Cuban blogosphere:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>blogs openly opposing the political regime</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>blogs that criticize the system, but from a position of commitment with socialism</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>blogs that defend the regime openly and uncritically</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GeneraciónY (GenerationY) — launched by Yoani Sánchez in 2007 — is the most widely know example of the first trend. Translated into more than seventeen languages, it has about 14 million monthly visitors (all languages) and each post usually receives hundreds of comments. Committed with helping “to build a plural, inclusive Cuba,” she declares she created the blog as “a medium that would allow me to tell all those stories that I saw every day and answer the questions that arose when looking at my reality.” Since the blog has been blocked from Cuba, she has had to practice a “blind blogging,” with no access to feedback from readers. She emailed her texts to friends abroad to post it for her, creating an offline network of people who guarantee its continuity. From May, 2014, Generación Y has become part of a major project: 14ymedio.com (English: 14andahalf), an independent digital newspaper, described as the “development of a personal adventure that has become a collective project.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_gPon-H-fpLXHdjGf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>La Polémica Digital (The Digital Controversy) — launched in 2008 by Elaine Díaz, a Cuban journalist, as a “space to discuss on Cuba” — is an example of the second above-mentioned trend. Each entry in the blog has a number of comments ranging from ten to 50, and there are more than 900 persons who like it in Facebook. Topics on the blog range from issues on digital journalism to criticisms on aspects and situations of everyday life in Cuba (corruption, censorship in the press). Due to her commitment to the systems, she acknowledges that there are taboo subjects, like education or health care, and even confesses her fear of posting something that could be misunderstood and then be punished. The blog has certain “rules of the game”: five points about the assumptions on which comments will be removed, for achieving a “peaceful coexistence” among readers. After a year online, comments began to be moderated, arguing the blog was not a chat or discussion forum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_bsQqzTb9XvnQLuev.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, El Blog de Yohandry (Yohandry’s Blog) shows the third trend. Created in 2008 too, its author was a frequent participant in Generación Y by commenting on it but, arguing that he had been blocked, he created his own blog. Firstly, the blogger — who remains incognito — created a blog hosted by <em>El País</em> and open to comments but, after some time, he denounced his blog had been blocked and then moved towards Wordpress. Currently, the blog has its own domain and comments are controlled, since the blogger decided not to give space to “subversive messages.”However, the number of comments has decreased to the point that most posts have no comments. One of its main topic has been the “denouncement” of Yoani Sánchez and there is even a section dedicated to her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_RbYZRMvMhM2fLP8O.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This diversity shows the political divide in the Cuban blogosphere, even in the blogger’s communities, divided into Bloggers Cuba (community of revolutionary bloggers) and Cuban Voices (community of dissident bloggers).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; There is a deep polarization among Cuban bloggers, following the three trends identified and its corresponding inflexible political views, mainly in first and third cases.</p>\n<p>This mediates the conditions of possibility for the Cuban blogosphere to become a space for a dialogue between dissents and, consequently, a scenario of collective political participation. However, its importance is generally acknowledged, and even a U.S. diplomatic attended a pro-governmental bloggers’ meeting in Havana.</p>\n<p>The scenario is complex. On the one hand, the Union of Journalists of Cuba, the official professional organization, encourages its members to create blogs, even providing them a specific platform. Within and outside it, Cuban journalists create blogs, many of them as an explicitly declared space for debate, beyond mainstream media where they work. On the other hand, individuals opposed to the regime also create blogs for debate, even reaching to become independent media. This summarizes the complexity of the blogosphere’s appropriation by Cubans for sociopolitical participation.</p>\n<p>In general, there is a limited impact of blogging in state-owned Cuba’s media system.

Despite this, the number of blogs on and from Cuba have raised over the past years. On November, 2007 there were 156 blogs on Cuba; six years later, this reached the number of 1239 blogs. Blogs are considered an effective way for political participation that has altered political communication (Woodly 2014). In a context where all the media are state-owned, this role has some particularities: blogs could open a significant opportunity for citizens to have a space of expression, qualified as “[doors open to controversy and debate](http://quovadiscuba.wordpress.com/),” by an official Cuban journalist and blogger.\n\nThere are three trends in the Cuban blogosphere:\n\n1. blogs openly opposing the political regime\n\n2. blogs that criticize the system, but from a position of commitment with socialism\n\n3. blogs that defend the regime openly and uncritically\n\nGeneraciónY (GenerationY) — launched by Yoani Sánchez in 2007 — is the most widely know example of the first trend. Translated into more than seventeen languages, it has about 14 million monthly visitors (all languages) and each post usually receives hundreds of comments. Committed with helping “to build a plural, inclusive Cuba,” she declares she created the blog as “a medium that would allow me to tell all those stories that I saw every day and answer the questions that arose when looking at my reality.” Since the blog has been blocked from Cuba, she has had to practice a “blind blogging,” with no access to feedback from readers. She emailed her texts to friends abroad to post it for her, creating an offline network of people who guarantee its continuity. From May, 2014, Generación Y has become part of a major project: 14ymedio.com (English: 14andahalf), an independent digital newspaper, described as the “development of a personal adventure that has become a collective project.”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_gPon-H-fpLXHdjGf.jpg)\n\nLa Polémica Digital (The Digital Controversy) — launched in 2008 by Elaine Díaz, a Cuban journalist, as a “space to discuss on Cuba” — is an example of the second above-mentioned trend. Each entry in the blog has a number of comments ranging from ten to 50, and there are more than 900 persons who like it in Facebook. Topics on the blog range from issues on digital journalism to criticisms on aspects and situations of everyday life in Cuba (corruption, censorship in the press). Due to her commitment to the systems, she acknowledges that there are taboo subjects, like education or health care, and even confesses her fear of posting something that could be misunderstood and then be punished. The blog has certain “rules of the game”: five points about the assumptions on which comments will be removed, for achieving a “peaceful coexistence” among readers. After a year online, comments began to be moderated, arguing the blog was not a chat or discussion forum.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_bsQqzTb9XvnQLuev.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, El Blog de Yohandry (Yohandry’s Blog) shows the third trend. Created in 2008 too, its author was a frequent participant in Generación Y by commenting on it but, arguing that he had been blocked, he created his own blog. Firstly, the blogger — who remains incognito — created a blog hosted by _El País_ and open to comments but, after some time, he denounced his blog had been blocked and then moved towards Wordpress. Currently, the blog has its own domain and comments are controlled, since the blogger decided not to give space to “subversive messages.”However, the number of comments has decreased to the point that most posts have no comments. One of its main topic has been the “denouncement” of Yoani Sánchez and there is even a section dedicated to her.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_RbYZRMvMhM2fLP8O.jpg)\n\nThis diversity shows the political divide in the Cuban blogosphere, even in the blogger’s communities, divided into Bloggers Cuba (community of revolutionary bloggers) and Cuban Voices (community of dissident bloggers).\n\n&gt; &gt; There is a deep polarization among Cuban bloggers, following the three trends identified and its corresponding inflexible political views, mainly in first and third cases.\n\nThis mediates the conditions of possibility for the Cuban blogosphere to become a space for a dialogue between dissents and, consequently, a scenario of collective political participation. However, its importance is generally acknowledged, and even a U.S. diplomatic attended a pro-governmental bloggers’ meeting in Havana.\n\nThe scenario is complex. On the one hand, the Union of Journalists of Cuba, the official professional organization, encourages its members to create blogs, even providing them a specific platform. Within and outside it, Cuban journalists create blogs, many of them as an explicitly declared space for debate, beyond mainstream media where they work. On the other hand, individuals opposed to the regime also create blogs for debate, even reaching to become independent media. This summarizes the complexity of the blogosphere’s appropriation by Cubans for sociopolitical participation.\n\nIn general, there is a limited impact of blogging in state-owned Cuba’s media system. Official media websites only include links to blogs from their own journalists, and references to other blogs are limited to news on meetings held by communities of revolutionary bloggers, or prizes awarded to blogs on specific issues, such as sexuality education. Although some bloggers have considered that, in some cases, the presence of some issues on Cuban blogs have forced media system to include it on their agendas, one almost can not find explicit examples of news in official media quoting as source a blogger or a post on Cuban blogosphere. This divide among media system and an alternative blogosphere, blocks the emergence of an enriched and open public sphere as a result of the impact of blogging in providing a debate/dissent scenario for sociopolitical participation.\n\n# References\n\nWoodly, Deva. 2008. “New competencies in democratic communication?

Unlike other streams of information, social media data — albeit noisy and biased — provides a real-time window into the social life of city inhabitants and their activity, in a manner that was not accessible before and may not be easily attainable from other sources.</p>\n<p>The substantial adoption of social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, especially in fast-growing global cities, is now providing access to large volumes of geo-tagged data that may reflect people’s local activities and actions. This project examines how real-time geo-tagged social media data could be useful for journalists. Based on initial interviews with a group of journalists and local government officials, CityBeat was developed as an ambient display visualization interface to support the discovery of hyperlocal events in highly dense populated urban areas. CityBeat was co-developed with a group of journalists in an iterative design process, and deployed at several well-established news organizations in New York City.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OOafvlH2v5QeXyrN.png\" alt=\"Architecture of CityBeat\"></p>\n<p>CityBeat was designed as an ambient interface with a map-based component, using visual cues for spikes of activity and key elements that require user attention. The system is implemented as a web-based ambient visualization meant for large displays in a newsroom or similar setting. The visualization, based on data from Instagram and Twitter, has three main components: the Detected Events List, Event Window, and the Statistics Sidebar. The Detected Events List is based on a social media event detection algorithm using Instagram data, and is visualized as an auto-scrolling list of all events discovered from the data in the past 24 hours. Each detected event on the list is noted on the background map by a pulsing circle placed in a specific geographical location. As the map moves from one location to another at the center of the screen, an Event Window presents a summary of the currently in-focus event including keywords, time of detection, and relevant photos, all automatically computed by the CityBeat system. To detect events in a stream of city-level social media data, we devised and implemented an algorithm that is geared to extract hyperlocal events, namely events that are occurring in a small region, e.g. a street corner or a venue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0___PhwdYXicW4l325.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of CityBeat ambient dis-play interface with 4 components: Detected Events List, Event Window, Statistics Sidebar and Trend-ing Venues Ticker.\"></p>\n<p>Performing robust hyperlocal event detection is challenging given the noise and scale of social media data, where the sparse signal for any location can be easily overwhelmed by irrelevant content. Since discovering and following breaking events in real-time is highly important for journalists, the CityBeat system focuses not only on robust and precise detection but also in real time. The algorithm uses geo-tagged Instagram data. Instagram is a popular photo sharing service that allows users to add location information to their photo. CityBeat collects all geotagged photos shared from New York City, averaging about 80,000 items per day (as of May 2014). Instagram data was selected first based on two main reasons: (1) The number of geotagged posts on Instagram is significantly higher than on Twitter and (2) In many cases Instagram photos depict the physical place in which they were taken. This is in contrary to geotagged Twitter posts that can refer to many other topics such as world news. Future iterations of the system plan on incorporating additional data from Twitter posts.</p>\n<p>The system divides the data to sub-regions and models the time series data for each sub-region. An online alert engine compares the region’s real-time data with the time series model for that region. If the engine discovers a significant deviation from the predicted amount of data (indicating a burst of social media activity), a candidate event is created, containing all the photos that contributed to the abnormal signal. In the following step, the candidate event is represented using a vector of spatial, lexical/topical and historical features based on the photos’ data. A trained classifier determines whether the candidate event is a true event, based on these features.</p>\n<p>A final step uses real-time crowdsourcing to improve the classification precision by removing false positives. Events are instantly sent to Amazon Mechanical Turk workers which are then asked to cast their judgment about the existence of an event, the type of event as well as help curate the relevant photos. In this way, detected events are further analyzed to find representative photos and flag important event keywords. Since the launch of the system, CityBeat detected events such as conferences, music concerts, outdoor festivals, gallery openings, sports events as well as emergencies like fires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_hHPnuGXMqSpTxeKx.png\" alt=\"As an example, this event page shows the photos of the ﬁre detected on Nov 17, 2013 at West Village.\"></p>\n<p>The Statistics Sidebar provide aggregate representation of social media including the number of tweets and photos posted in the last hour in New York together with the percentage of change from the previous hour, the top most-mentioned Twitter accounts during the past hour in Twitter items geotagged to New York City, and the five most retweeted tweets that were geo-tagged in New York. We also show the city’s trending topics extracted from Twitter API.</p>\n<p>In this sidebar, we also plot the time series of photos and tweets volume for the city during the past 24 hours. The data from the past 24 hours are visualized by a solid colored curve, while the dashed curve represents the predicted time series (expected, “normal” levels). These two curves, representing the city’s historical data vs. live data, can provide a quick visual indication when some unusual city-wide activity is occurring. These three components construct CityBeat: a social media dashboard for cities that utilizes information from multiple publicly available social streams to help journalists and newsrooms find local news events.</p>\n<p>During 2014, the CityBeat team worked closely with <a href=\"http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/\">The New York World</a> editors and reporters. Working with The New York World provided indispensable editorial direction for the development of CityBeat, including shaping training data to help the CityBeat algorithm identify true events and reject false events; and ensuring the ambient display meets the needs of newsrooms seeking to discover untapped information and images. The <a href=\"http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2014/01/02/de-blasio-inaugural/\">World</a> has also used CityBeat to curate coverage of the mayor’s inauguration and find images and sources for news events. CityBeat is on constant display in the newsroom, provoking ongoing discussion and feedback in a live context, and guiding ongoing project development.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; CityBeat is part of a larger effort to build new tools and systems to support the rapid growth of urban habitats.</p>\n<p>Developers and researchers collaborate with CityBeat to contemplate the ways in which local information is discovered and propagated in years to come.

Unlike other streams of information, social media data — albeit noisy and biased — provides a real-time window into the social life of city inhabitants and their activity, in a manner that was not accessible before and may not be easily attainable from other sources.\n\nThe substantial adoption of social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, especially in fast-growing global cities, is now providing access to large volumes of geo-tagged data that may reflect people’s local activities and actions. This project examines how real-time geo-tagged social media data could be useful for journalists. Based on initial interviews with a group of journalists and local government officials, CityBeat was developed as an ambient display visualization interface to support the discovery of hyperlocal events in highly dense populated urban areas. CityBeat was co-developed with a group of journalists in an iterative design process, and deployed at several well-established news organizations in New York City.\n\n![Architecture of CityBeat](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OOafvlH2v5QeXyrN.png)\n\nCityBeat was designed as an ambient interface with a map-based component, using visual cues for spikes of activity and key elements that require user attention. The system is implemented as a web-based ambient visualization meant for large displays in a newsroom or similar setting. The visualization, based on data from Instagram and Twitter, has three main components: the Detected Events List, Event Window, and the Statistics Sidebar. The Detected Events List is based on a social media event detection algorithm using Instagram data, and is visualized as an auto-scrolling list of all events discovered from the data in the past 24 hours. Each detected event on the list is noted on the background map by a pulsing circle placed in a specific geographical location. As the map moves from one location to another at the center of the screen, an Event Window presents a summary of the currently in-focus event including keywords, time of detection, and relevant photos, all automatically computed by the CityBeat system. To detect events in a stream of city-level social media data, we devised and implemented an algorithm that is geared to extract hyperlocal events, namely events that are occurring in a small region, e.g. a street corner or a venue.\n\n![Screen shot of CityBeat ambient dis-play interface with 4 components: Detected Events List, Event Window, Statistics Sidebar and Trend-ing Venues Ticker.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0___PhwdYXicW4l325.png)\n\nPerforming robust hyperlocal event detection is challenging given the noise and scale of social media data, where the sparse signal for any location can be easily overwhelmed by irrelevant content. Since discovering and following breaking events in real-time is highly important for journalists, the CityBeat system focuses not only on robust and precise detection but also in real time. The algorithm uses geo-tagged Instagram data. Instagram is a popular photo sharing service that allows users to add location information to their photo. CityBeat collects all geotagged photos shared from New York City, averaging about 80,000 items per day (as of May 2014). Instagram data was selected first based on two main reasons: (1) The number of geotagged posts on Instagram is significantly higher than on Twitter and (2) In many cases Instagram photos depict the physical place in which they were taken. This is in contrary to geotagged Twitter posts that can refer to many other topics such as world news. Future iterations of the system plan on incorporating additional data from Twitter posts.\n\nThe system divides the data to sub-regions and models the time series data for each sub-region. An online alert engine compares the region’s real-time data with the time series model for that region. If the engine discovers a significant deviation from the predicted amount of data (indicating a burst of social media activity), a candidate event is created, containing all the photos that contributed to the abnormal signal. In the following step, the candidate event is represented using a vector of spatial, lexical/topical and historical features based on the photos’ data. A trained classifier determines whether the candidate event is a true event, based on these features.\n\nA final step uses real-time crowdsourcing to improve the classification precision by removing false positives. Events are instantly sent to Amazon Mechanical Turk workers which are then asked to cast their judgment about the existence of an event, the type of event as well as help curate the relevant photos. In this way, detected events are further analyzed to find representative photos and flag important event keywords. Since the launch of the system, CityBeat detected events such as conferences, music concerts, outdoor festivals, gallery openings, sports events as well as emergencies like fires.\n\n![As an example, this event page shows the photos of the ﬁre detected on Nov 17, 2013 at West Village.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_hHPnuGXMqSpTxeKx.png)\n\nThe Statistics Sidebar provide aggregate representation of social media including the number of tweets and photos posted in the last hour in New York together with the percentage of change from the previous hour, the top most-mentioned Twitter accounts during the past hour in Twitter items geotagged to New York City, and the five most retweeted tweets that were geo-tagged in New York. We also show the city’s trending topics extracted from Twitter API.\n\nIn this sidebar, we also plot the time series of photos and tweets volume for the city during the past 24 hours. The data from the past 24 hours are visualized by a solid colored curve, while the dashed curve represents the predicted time series (expected, “normal” levels). These two curves, representing the city’s historical data vs. live data, can provide a quick visual indication when some unusual city-wide activity is occurring. These three components construct CityBeat: a social media dashboard for cities that utilizes information from multiple publicly available social streams to help journalists and newsrooms find local news events.\n\nDuring 2014, the CityBeat team worked closely with [The New York World](http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/) editors and reporters. Working with The New York World provided indispensable editorial direction for the development of CityBeat, including shaping training data to help the CityBeat algorithm identify true events and reject false events; and ensuring the ambient display meets the needs of newsrooms seeking to discover untapped information and images. The [World](http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2014/01/02/de-blasio-inaugural/) has also used CityBeat to curate coverage of the mayor’s inauguration and find images and sources for news events. CityBeat is on constant display in the newsroom, provoking ongoing discussion and feedback in a live context, and guiding ongoing project development.\n\n&gt; &gt; CityBeat is part of a larger effort to build new tools and systems to support the rapid growth of urban habitats.\n\nDevelopers and researchers collaborate with CityBeat to contemplate the ways in which local information is discovered and propagated in years to come. CityBeat is a first prototype of these future systems to produce and disseminate local news.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

This emerged as the biggest election in the world, comprising of 815 million registered voters . It also noticed an increase of 8.19% voter turnout, as compared to the previous election held in 2009. In the past fifteen elections, the voter participation has been an average of 59.37% (Appendix 1). It surpassed that average once in 1984, with a turnout of 64.01%. Since then, this has been the only instance in the history of independent India when the voter turnout has been 66.4%.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Voting is a democratic right, which asserts the electoral choices of the citizens of the country. However, not all registered voters engage in the electoral participation. The fact that India does not have compulsory voting is an important aspect affecting its turnout.</p>\n<p>Unlike in western democracies specially the USA, voters from rural areas and economically disadvantaged are more inclined to cast their ballot as compared to the more educated and urban-bred voters. Past literature on voter behavior and participation has been limited to the western democracies, neglecting the newer democracies of the global south.</p>\n<p>Based on the various macro and micro theories of voter turnout, the turnout is dependent on the individuals, countries, and the election . Internet Based Communication technologies (ICTs) are gradually emerging as an important factor-influencing turnout. There is no denying that sharing of information is easier owing to ICTs, thus motivating individuals to vote.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; During the ten phased elections in India, Facebook and Twitter witnessed a surge in sharing of voting images (selfies with inked finger), messages and hashtags, specifically by the millennial generation.</p>\n<p>Thus creating a campaign in their network to encourage voting. Some of the major factors resulting in the increase of voter turnout include the increase of registered voters and the use of ICTs in political information and discussion. ICTs successfully steered the campaign for voting rights in urban areas. Publicized as the first social media elections in India, the social media platforms helped create an environment of positive peer pressure, and encouraged the right to vote in their network. The 2014 Indian election saw a rise in motivation in the voter due to the country’s internal political situation and the hyper-information sharing in voters. Some of the popular hashtags during the ten-phase elections were #MyIndiaMyVote, #VoteIndia, #GetInked, and #Govote. These figured prominently in the searches conducted in Facebook and Twitter, generating an average of 150 tweets and re-tweets and shared-status messages in Facebook.</p>\n<p>These hashtags indicate that the citizens were not only voting, but also using the social media platform as a mechanism to encourage their network to exercise their right to vote. The influence of social networks in voting is well documented in research (Fosco et al. 2011). However, this case study addresses networks based on ICTs, where processing and sharing of information are faster, and not random physical social networks.</p>\n<p>Past research on voter turnout in western democracies indicate that the turnout depends on the utility of feeling valued, which is also the premise of the Rational Choice Argument (Blais and Young 1999). But in some cases, pure rational choice theory is unsuccessful in explaining voter turnout. Scholars only emphasize on individual utility and decision-making affecting turnout (Singh 2011), overlooking the other areas relevant internationally.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Social media engagement in voters can change the feeling of utility to that of obligation.</p>\n<p>In this case, it spontaneously created a sense of obligation in their network, by sharing the various voting hashtags and, in some cases, selfies (Appendix 2). This obligation becomes a part of the ethical consideration and civic duty (Birnir 2007). However, in this case study, voting could be a result of “social media obligation” or “technological obligation” on the part of the voters. The technological approach (also called the digital peer pressure approach) is helpful in curbing political apathy by using technological peer pressure on the voters; it may be an emerging paradigm. The social media platforms inculcate a type of group behavior that is an effect of interaction within these groups — by the way of using the various hashtags. Turnout increases significantly due to the group dynamics (Geys 2006).</p>\n<p>Rational choice theorizing is based on the premises that voter turnout depends when personal benefits exceed personal cost. In this context, the personal benefits would be participating in the elections, and also being a part of the coveted “responsibility peer group.” Participation in the online engagement using the vote hashtags and selfies is perceived as an act of responsibility. The press in the past has consistently blamed citizen disengagement for low voter turnout (Wolfinger 1991). Historically, it has been seen that the changes in communications can alter the role of media in elections (Tolbert and McNeal 2001). These scholars have also noted that the media including the Internet provides information and stimulates motivation in the voters in electoral participation. In the past, there has been inadequate discussion on the mechanism of motivation and interest on voting. Internet has also undergone changes in the past decade. ICTs now include social media networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which in this election have been able to engage voters by sharing hashtags and creating a mechanism of peer pressure. Some of the common tweets were: “I have voted now it’s your turn”; “Do your bit” (Appendix 2). However, this is not a foolproof mechanism as Internet access is still limited to urban areas; significant populations of absentee voters also include non-resident citizens.</p>\n<p>This case study is an indication of the effect that ICTs can have on voter turnout in a country — a place where Internet penetration is still limited to the urban and semi urban regions. Described as the first social elections in the largest democracy, digital peer pressure has the capacity to inspire people to cast their votes by sharing information and encouraging their network to do the same.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Birnir, Johana Kristin. “Divergence in Diversity?

Past literature on voter behavior and participation has been limited to the western democracies, neglecting the newer democracies of the global south.\n\nBased on the various macro and micro theories of voter turnout, the turnout is dependent on the individuals, countries, and the election . Internet Based Communication technologies (ICTs) are gradually emerging as an important factor-influencing turnout. There is no denying that sharing of information is easier owing to ICTs, thus motivating individuals to vote.\n\n&gt; &gt; During the ten phased elections in India, Facebook and Twitter witnessed a surge in sharing of voting images (selfies with inked finger), messages and hashtags, specifically by the millennial generation.\n\nThus creating a campaign in their network to encourage voting. Some of the major factors resulting in the increase of voter turnout include the increase of registered voters and the use of ICTs in political information and discussion. ICTs successfully steered the campaign for voting rights in urban areas. Publicized as the first social media elections in India, the social media platforms helped create an environment of positive peer pressure, and encouraged the right to vote in their network. The 2014 Indian election saw a rise in motivation in the voter due to the country’s internal political situation and the hyper-information sharing in voters. Some of the popular hashtags during the ten-phase elections were #MyIndiaMyVote, #VoteIndia, #GetInked, and #Govote. These figured prominently in the searches conducted in Facebook and Twitter, generating an average of 150 tweets and re-tweets and shared-status messages in Facebook.\n\nThese hashtags indicate that the citizens were not only voting, but also using the social media platform as a mechanism to encourage their network to exercise their right to vote. The influence of social networks in voting is well documented in research (Fosco et al. 2011). However, this case study addresses networks based on ICTs, where processing and sharing of information are faster, and not random physical social networks.\n\nPast research on voter turnout in western democracies indicate that the turnout depends on the utility of feeling valued, which is also the premise of the Rational Choice Argument (Blais and Young 1999). But in some cases, pure rational choice theory is unsuccessful in explaining voter turnout. Scholars only emphasize on individual utility and decision-making affecting turnout (Singh 2011), overlooking the other areas relevant internationally.\n\n&gt; &gt; Social media engagement in voters can change the feeling of utility to that of obligation.\n\nIn this case, it spontaneously created a sense of obligation in their network, by sharing the various voting hashtags and, in some cases, selfies (Appendix 2). This obligation becomes a part of the ethical consideration and civic duty (Birnir 2007). However, in this case study, voting could be a result of “social media obligation” or “technological obligation” on the part of the voters. The technological approach (also called the digital peer pressure approach) is helpful in curbing political apathy by using technological peer pressure on the voters; it may be an emerging paradigm. The social media platforms inculcate a type of group behavior that is an effect of interaction within these groups — by the way of using the various hashtags. Turnout increases significantly due to the group dynamics (Geys 2006).\n\nRational choice theorizing is based on the premises that voter turnout depends when personal benefits exceed personal cost. In this context, the personal benefits would be participating in the elections, and also being a part of the coveted “responsibility peer group.” Participation in the online engagement using the vote hashtags and selfies is perceived as an act of responsibility. The press in the past has consistently blamed citizen disengagement for low voter turnout (Wolfinger 1991). Historically, it has been seen that the changes in communications can alter the role of media in elections (Tolbert and McNeal 2001). These scholars have also noted that the media including the Internet provides information and stimulates motivation in the voters in electoral participation. In the past, there has been inadequate discussion on the mechanism of motivation and interest on voting. Internet has also undergone changes in the past decade. ICTs now include social media networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which in this election have been able to engage voters by sharing hashtags and creating a mechanism of peer pressure. Some of the common tweets were: “I have voted now it’s your turn”; “Do your bit” (Appendix 2). However, this is not a foolproof mechanism as Internet access is still limited to urban areas; significant populations of absentee voters also include non-resident citizens.\n\nThis case study is an indication of the effect that ICTs can have on voter turnout in a country — a place where Internet penetration is still limited to the urban and semi urban regions. Described as the first social elections in the largest democracy, digital peer pressure has the capacity to inspire people to cast their votes by sharing information and encouraging their network to do the same.\n\n# References\n\nBirnir, Johana Kristin. “Divergence in Diversity?

However, rather than referring to individuals self-organizing to speak up to power and advance a specific agenda, the idea of mass mobilization that has inspired those who envisioned Woredanet and Schoolnet dates back to the time in which the precursor of Ethiopia’s ruling party, the guerrilla movement known as Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), was fighting the USSR-backed dictatorship of the Derg, and is firmly rooted in Marxist-Leninist thinking. As a former guerrilla fighter explained, mass mobilization implied a centralized connection between a vanguard and the masses:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>We always said that whatever policy we decide to develop, it will always be the farmers and the peasants to implement it.

But this has to be implemented on the ground. So technology is used to disseminate ideas but also to achieve results, otherwise people will know that what you say is just words (</em>Ababa 2008).</p>\n<p>Mass mobilization has been at the core of numerous revolutions throughout history. It refers to the need to activate large numbers to guarantee the success of a specific political project, and its nature varies according to the relationship between the mobilizing and the mobilized (Goldstone 2001). Since the beginning of the guerrilla struggle against the Derg regime, the commitment to the peasantry played a central role in legitimizing the TPLF political project, but also served as a populist means to affirm its control over Ethiopian citizens. Woredanet and Schoolnet represent a modern and technologically enhanced emanation of this longstanding strategy. The two systems on the one hand improve service delivery and the quality of life in rural communities, but on the other they also increase the presence of the state on the ground, opening new communication channels directly with the grassroots. The strategy has both practical and symbolic components. As a former guerrilla fighter and later government minister explained:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>Woredanet is for different purposes. It is to strengthen the capacity of the public administration, but it is also to reach rural Ethiopia, to make sure that the farmers get the right information. Woredanet is part of the wider communication strategy we have developed. Instead of communicating with everybody, we prefer to communicate with the most advanced part of the society and let it be our messenger (</em>Simon 2008).</p>\n<p>When Woredanet and Schoolnet were first envisioned, they were meant to build the capacity of the peripheral nodes of the state by training and instructing individuals, some of whom had little formal education, and enable them to provide better services. This had to benefit the whole community, but at the same time it also had to symbolize the commitment of the government to the rural population. The “most advanced part of the society” was required to demonstrate the principles inspiring the Ethiopian state through their actions and become the leaders and disseminators of a wider strategy.</p>\n<p>As a complement to Woredanet, Schoolnet was designed to reach targets in the peripheries in a more direct way. The main objective of Schoolnet was to enable students living in the countryside to have access to education of the same quality as those in the major towns and cities. Since the system became functional, students in remote areas no longer had to rely on poorly trained teachers for their education, as was often the case. This became a powerful symbol of the EPRDF’s commitment to guarantee every citizen equal opportunities.</p>\n<p>Although both Woredanet and Schoolnet are based on the Internet Protocol and intended to deliver a variety of services, the very limited access provided for data from outside Ethiopia has transformed the systems into a “state Intranet.” In the case of Woredanet, for a long time videoconferencing was the only system to be employed. Similarly, although some Schoolnet sites were supposed to receive an Internet connection, most of them did not, or did so only for a short period of time. This means that most, if not all, information being received through the systems comes exclusively from the centre of the state.</p>\n<p>Woredanet and Schoolnet function as communication channels that are partially invisible to a large component of the Ethiopian society. Woredanet allows exclusive and routine communication between nodes of the state. Schoolnet ensures that the new generation is exposed to messages decided at the centre, without the mediation of possibly critical teachers, and it also allows the government to reach wider constituencies discretely. Woredanet and Schoolnet assist the government in expanding its sphere of influence through the use of technology.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Gagliardone, Iginio “’A Country in Order’: Technopolitics, Nation Building, and the Development of ICT in Ethiopia.” Information Technologies &amp; International Development, 10, 1 (2014): 3–19.</p>\n<p>Goldstone, Jack “Toward a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory,” Annual Review of Political Science 4 (2001): 139–87.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

Instead of communicating with everybody, we prefer to communicate with the most advanced part of the society and let it be our messenger (*Simon 2008).\n\nWhen Woredanet and Schoolnet were first envisioned, they were meant to build the capacity of the peripheral nodes of the state by training and instructing individuals, some of whom had little formal education, and enable them to provide better services. This had to benefit the whole community, but at the same time it also had to symbolize the commitment of the government to the rural population. The “most advanced part of the society” was required to demonstrate the principles inspiring the Ethiopian state through their actions and become the leaders and disseminators of a wider strategy.\n\nAs a complement to Woredanet, Schoolnet was designed to reach targets in the peripheries in a more direct way. The main objective of Schoolnet was to enable students living in the countryside to have access to education of the same quality as those in the major towns and cities. Since the system became functional, students in remote areas no longer had to rely on poorly trained teachers for their education, as was often the case. This became a powerful symbol of the EPRDF’s commitment to guarantee every citizen equal opportunities.\n\nAlthough both Woredanet and Schoolnet are based on the Internet Protocol and intended to deliver a variety of services, the very limited access provided for data from outside Ethiopia has transformed the systems into a “state Intranet.” In the case of Woredanet, for a long time videoconferencing was the only system to be employed. Similarly, although some Schoolnet sites were supposed to receive an Internet connection, most of them did not, or did so only for a short period of time. This means that most, if not all, information being received through the systems comes exclusively from the centre of the state.\n\nWoredanet and Schoolnet function as communication channels that are partially invisible to a large component of the Ethiopian society. Woredanet allows exclusive and routine communication between nodes of the state. Schoolnet ensures that the new generation is exposed to messages decided at the centre, without the mediation of possibly critical teachers, and it also allows the government to reach wider constituencies discretely. Woredanet and Schoolnet assist the government in expanding its sphere of influence through the use of technology.\n\n# References\n\nGagliardone, Iginio “’A Country in Order’: Technopolitics, Nation Building, and the Development of ICT in Ethiopia.” Information Technologies &amp; International Development, 10, 1 (2014): 3–19.\n\nGoldstone, Jack “Toward a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory,” Annual Review of Political Science 4 (2001): 139–87.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

Corruption could only be exposed from within: “someone would have to know that something wrong was going on and try to get that information from the public body” (Sipos 2013). Now it is possible for journalists and CSOs to proactively monitor procurement and highlight suspicious cases:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>In the past tips came from companies who felt passed over, and sometimes from officials.

That is mostly the case for tenders in smaller cities and in smaller places (Furnas 33:00–35:00).</em></p>\n<p>According to Adam Valček, “Previously, only a few people have read the contract, because contracts were unavailable.” Now “there are more tips, because people [are] reading contracts on the web” (Folentova, Valček 2013).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_JD9tuS1adeyhtqMW.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Veronika Folentova offered an example tip that was representative of these new sources. Teachers, she said, sent in information about Ministry of Education procurements for flowers in the amount of 9,900 Euros, and a contract for 36 bottles of alcohol for 132 Euros each (Folentova, Valček 2013). These small examples paint a picture of a type of contextualized, public and participatory oversight that would have been impossible without online publication. Lower barriers to using public information make this type of engagement possible.</p>\n<p>This access has made difference for businesses too. Robert Kicina noted that the only way to discover tender restriction manipulation is through public control and access to tenders. According to him, it is now easy for competitors to “look this up and send it to the media. This is the only mechanism that works in Slovakia…It is used by entrepreneurs to protect themselves from unfair competition and unfair procurement” (Kičina 2013).</p>\n<p>Local engagement of this kind brings an important type of diffuse knowledge to bear, which is otherwise hard to capture. At the local level, people are much more aware of relevant context. They may know who the mayor is friends with, and which local businesses have relationships with people of influence. Because of this contextual knowledge local activists can notice malfeasance that would not be evident to a researcher farther removed from the process.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The data that civil sector organizations have scraped and structured has enabled systematic analysis that was previously impossible.</p>\n<p>TI-Slovakia was able to conduct research that showed an increase in competition from 2.3 bids per tender in 2009 to 3.6 bids per tender in 2011, a positive indicator for the impact of reforms (Sipos 2012).</p>\n<p>Numbers of this kind were unavailable before the reforms. Citing a problematic, and “amateurish” lack of analytic capacity within the government, Sipos said “basically nobody had [these numbers], even the office of public procurement in Slovakia[…] Nobody noticed what was happening” (Sipos 2013).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_oMjFflESiS8nit9_.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The electronic availability of procurement information has greatly increased capacity across the civil sector:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>Before the publishing of the huge amount of data […] we needed to go through all contracts [individually] and now we can select hundreds or thousands of them which are suspicious and mark them […] we don’t need to waste our capacities on searching and going through all of them. We can do it electronically. We don’t need to request them according to the FOI law, going through all of them, so it increased our capacity very much (</em>Kunder 2013).</p>\n<p>Adam Valček and Veronika Folentova both stressed their reliance on this civil sector ecosystem in their work as journalists (Folentova and Valčekin 2013). Procurement processes are highly technical, and procurement data is often dense. Organizations like Fair Play and TI help make both the data and relevant expertise accessible. In fact, Veronika mentioned that she had taken a course on procurement offered by the Fair Play Alliance (Folentova and Valčekin 2013). By building civic tools like the Open Public Procurement Portal and serving as expert intermediaries, these civil sector groups have lowered the barriers for journalists and ultimately the public to engage with public procurement.</p>\n<p>Public procurement disclosure in Slovakia offers encouragement and caution about the effectiveness of transparency in combatting corruption. Watchdogs and journalists are now able to scrutinize more procurement proceedings, more intelligently refine their searches for suspect procurements and ultimately conduct more research, investigation and analysis. This expanded capacity has increased the likelihood that improper processes will be uncovered. However, there are still gains to be made by further lowering those costs. Data should all be proactively released in machine-readable bulk formats, which would save CSOs and researchers significant costs, thereby enabling them to better focus their resources on expanding their oversight work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Government Office for Public Procurement, Slovakia. “EVO Public Tenders Overview.”<a href=\"https://evo.gov.sk/evo/ethics.nsf/public_tenders2!OpenView\">https://evo.gov.sk/evo/ethics.nsf/public_tenders2!OpenView</a> (Accessed July 20, 2013).</p>\n<p>Government Office of Public Procurement, Slovakia.

Citing a problematic, and “amateurish” lack of analytic capacity within the government, Sipos said “basically nobody had [these numbers], even the office of public procurement in Slovakia[…] Nobody noticed what was happening” (Sipos 2013).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_oMjFflESiS8nit9_.png)\n\nThe electronic availability of procurement information has greatly increased capacity across the civil sector:\n\n&gt; &gt; *Before the publishing of the huge amount of data […] we needed to go through all contracts [individually] and now we can select hundreds or thousands of them which are suspicious and mark them […] we don’t need to waste our capacities on searching and going through all of them. We can do it electronically. We don’t need to request them according to the FOI law, going through all of them, so it increased our capacity very much (*Kunder 2013).\n\nAdam Valček and Veronika Folentova both stressed their reliance on this civil sector ecosystem in their work as journalists (Folentova and Valčekin 2013). Procurement processes are highly technical, and procurement data is often dense. Organizations like Fair Play and TI help make both the data and relevant expertise accessible. In fact, Veronika mentioned that she had taken a course on procurement offered by the Fair Play Alliance (Folentova and Valčekin 2013). By building civic tools like the Open Public Procurement Portal and serving as expert intermediaries, these civil sector groups have lowered the barriers for journalists and ultimately the public to engage with public procurement.\n\nPublic procurement disclosure in Slovakia offers encouragement and caution about the effectiveness of transparency in combatting corruption. Watchdogs and journalists are now able to scrutinize more procurement proceedings, more intelligently refine their searches for suspect procurements and ultimately conduct more research, investigation and analysis. This expanded capacity has increased the likelihood that improper processes will be uncovered. However, there are still gains to be made by further lowering those costs. Data should all be proactively released in machine-readable bulk formats, which would save CSOs and researchers significant costs, thereby enabling them to better focus their resources on expanding their oversight work.\n\n# References\n\nGovernment Office for Public Procurement, Slovakia. “EVO Public Tenders Overview.”[https://evo.gov.sk/evo/ethics.nsf/public_tenders2!OpenView](https://evo.gov.sk/evo/ethics.nsf/public_tenders2!OpenView) (Accessed July 20, 2013).\n\nGovernment Office of Public Procurement, Slovakia.

Nobody entered the race to unseat five incumbents. The city faced a challenge that is increasingly common across the United States: How to engage diverse residents and instill in them a sense of community (Ramakrishnan and Bloemraad 2008).</p>\n<p>Two years earlier, a research group from University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism began investigating how a local news product could improve civic engagement in Alhambra. The group, the Alhambra Project, defined civic engagement in three ways — residents’ feelings of attachment to their local community and neighborly behaviors (neighborhood belonging), their belief that neighbors can be counted on to solve shared problems (collective efficacy), and their involvement in civic activities (civic participation). This research was informed by the communication infrastructure theory (CIT), which elucidates the role of networked local communication agents (e.g. residents, local media, community organizations and public institutions) in enhancing engagement (Kim and Ball Rokeach 2006a, 2006b).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_f-jr66teROfL9is1.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise description of images: Alhambra Source, a community news site in suburban Los Angeles, worked with the police department to develop an outreach initiative using Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter.\"></p>\n<p>Within weeks of the elections being cancelled, the Alhambra Project launched the Alhambra Source. This local news outlet was set up to achieve several objectives, principally to promote a more engaged population and create connections across linguistic and cultural barriers (Chen et al. 2012). Alhambra is 53 percent Asian, 33 percent Hispanic, and 11 percent Anglo, according to the American Community Survey 2012 3-year summary data. Seventy-five percent of the population speaks a language other than English at home, with nearly half speaking an Asian language — primarily Mandarin or Cantonese — and 30 percent speaking Spanish. Research indicated that residents had overlapping local interests, but ethno-linguistic barriers had prevented them from engaging in information-sharing and civic dialogue. Without this type of communication, it is difficult to develop a sense of community and the capability for collective problem-solving (Anderson 1991, Friedland 2001). Consequently, the site’s coverage has focused on topics diverse residents identified as common concerns — such as crime, education, and city government — and these topics provided the basis for building virtual “communities of interest” across ethnicities.</p>\n<p>To further cross language and cultural barriers, Alhambra Source provides select trilingual content through original reporting and translation. To reach the area’s substantial Chinese population, Alhambra Source editors created connections with the Chinese ethnic media in the area. More than a half dozen Asian outlets covered the site’s launch; content exchanges were created with the leading Chinese language press in Southern California, World Journal; and the editorial staff hosted multilingual community forums. Within three years, the site has developed a network of 90 community contributors who speak 10 languages. They have written hundreds of articles, attended scores of editorial meetings, and been critical for meeting the objective of enabling participatory local storytelling through new technologies. Still, while content contributors and readership comes from diverse backgrounds, both groups remain primarily English dominant.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Sm07ri_RpIyOTzJC.jpg\" alt=\"A USC Annenberg graduate student Chi Zhang tests out Weibo on Valley Boulevard in Alhambra.\"></p>\n<p>Another objective was to help create connections among communication agents in the area, and this has led to one of the most interesting outcomes of the project. The strengthened communication network was the catalyst for the first US local law enforcement agency to launch a Sina Weibo account. Weibo is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and one of the most utilized social media platforms by Chinese at home and abroad (Dube 2014). The Alhambra Police Department, in launching its Weibo account, added a linguistic and cultural layer to a practice that public agencies across the country are increasingly adapting to reach marginalized residents (Kolb 2014).</p>\n<p>The use of Weibo is an example of how connecting with immigrant residents via their preferred social media platforms can impact civic engagement. Five days after launching, it attracted more than 5,000 followers, about five times the “likes” for the Facebook account the police department had spent more than a year building. Within four months, followers grew to more than 11,000. The immediate impact is clear: Cantonese and Mandarin calls to the department requiring translation increased 64 percent since launching (Yokoyama 2014). In an e-mail survey of users, more than 90 percent said they felt closer to and know more about local policing as a result of Weibo<a href=\"http://scalar.usc.edu/works/civic-media-project/new.edit#_edn1\">[i]</a>.</p>\n<p>The Weibo initiative was triggered after Alhambra Police Chief Mark Yokoyama read an article in Alhambra Source on engagement techniques to reach the Chinese community (Voluntary survey conducted with 121 Alhambra Weibo follwers 2014).

Nobody entered the race to unseat five incumbents. The city faced a challenge that is increasingly common across the United States: How to engage diverse residents and instill in them a sense of community (Ramakrishnan and Bloemraad 2008).\n\nTwo years earlier, a research group from University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism began investigating how a local news product could improve civic engagement in Alhambra. The group, the Alhambra Project, defined civic engagement in three ways — residents’ feelings of attachment to their local community and neighborly behaviors (neighborhood belonging), their belief that neighbors can be counted on to solve shared problems (collective efficacy), and their involvement in civic activities (civic participation). This research was informed by the communication infrastructure theory (CIT), which elucidates the role of networked local communication agents (e.g. residents, local media, community organizations and public institutions) in enhancing engagement (Kim and Ball Rokeach 2006a, 2006b).\n\n![Clockwise description of images: Alhambra Source, a community news site in suburban Los Angeles, worked with the police department to develop an outreach initiative using Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_f-jr66teROfL9is1.jpg)\n\nWithin weeks of the elections being cancelled, the Alhambra Project launched the Alhambra Source. This local news outlet was set up to achieve several objectives, principally to promote a more engaged population and create connections across linguistic and cultural barriers (Chen et al. 2012). Alhambra is 53 percent Asian, 33 percent Hispanic, and 11 percent Anglo, according to the American Community Survey 2012 3-year summary data. Seventy-five percent of the population speaks a language other than English at home, with nearly half speaking an Asian language — primarily Mandarin or Cantonese — and 30 percent speaking Spanish. Research indicated that residents had overlapping local interests, but ethno-linguistic barriers had prevented them from engaging in information-sharing and civic dialogue. Without this type of communication, it is difficult to develop a sense of community and the capability for collective problem-solving (Anderson 1991, Friedland 2001). Consequently, the site’s coverage has focused on topics diverse residents identified as common concerns — such as crime, education, and city government — and these topics provided the basis for building virtual “communities of interest” across ethnicities.\n\nTo further cross language and cultural barriers, Alhambra Source provides select trilingual content through original reporting and translation. To reach the area’s substantial Chinese population, Alhambra Source editors created connections with the Chinese ethnic media in the area. More than a half dozen Asian outlets covered the site’s launch; content exchanges were created with the leading Chinese language press in Southern California, World Journal; and the editorial staff hosted multilingual community forums. Within three years, the site has developed a network of 90 community contributors who speak 10 languages. They have written hundreds of articles, attended scores of editorial meetings, and been critical for meeting the objective of enabling participatory local storytelling through new technologies. Still, while content contributors and readership comes from diverse backgrounds, both groups remain primarily English dominant.\n\n![A USC Annenberg graduate student Chi Zhang tests out Weibo on Valley Boulevard in Alhambra.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Sm07ri_RpIyOTzJC.jpg)\n\nAnother objective was to help create connections among communication agents in the area, and this has led to one of the most interesting outcomes of the project. The strengthened communication network was the catalyst for the first US local law enforcement agency to launch a Sina Weibo account. Weibo is the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and one of the most utilized social media platforms by Chinese at home and abroad (Dube 2014). The Alhambra Police Department, in launching its Weibo account, added a linguistic and cultural layer to a practice that public agencies across the country are increasingly adapting to reach marginalized residents (Kolb 2014).\n\nThe use of Weibo is an example of how connecting with immigrant residents via their preferred social media platforms can impact civic engagement. Five days after launching, it attracted more than 5,000 followers, about five times the “likes” for the Facebook account the police department had spent more than a year building. Within four months, followers grew to more than 11,000. The immediate impact is clear: Cantonese and Mandarin calls to the department requiring translation increased 64 percent since launching (Yokoyama 2014). In an e-mail survey of users, more than 90 percent said they felt closer to and know more about local policing as a result of Weibo[[i]](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/civic-media-project/new.edit#_edn1).\n\nThe Weibo initiative was triggered after Alhambra Police Chief Mark Yokoyama read an article in Alhambra Source on engagement techniques to reach the Chinese community (Voluntary survey conducted with 121 Alhambra Weibo follwers 2014). The chief asked for a meeting with the editorial staff and the author, courts interpreter and site community contributor Walter Yu. To reach younger and more recent immigrants, Yu suggested the department develop Weibo. He also offered to help make it happen by sharing his social media skills.\n\n![Alhambra Police Chief Mark Yokoyama presents the department’s Weibo initiative.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_f1bSAFrK9rx18wX5.jpg)\n\nWhile many of the recent Chinese immigrants in Alhambra did not read the site, some influential ones did. Yu is an example of how incorporating local voices into the communications outreach strategy can help activate and enhance Chinese local storytelling and connect it with mainstream outlets and government officials. The Alhambra Source, Yu and the police chief developed a system for taking in questions, translating them, and sharing them with the public, and Yu also created an #AskAmericanPolice campaign for the Alhambra Police Department.

Pop-Up Newsroom denizens report for limited time periods, disseminating their stories instantaneously with their own cell phones and personal social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, etc. A shared hashtag networks their reporting. Rather than trying to drive audiences to a single organizational website, the project creates information surges via social media.

These curators monitor students’ and the general public’s social media posts about the same topic, selecting content to redistribute via Pop-Up Newsroom social media accounts. Often, the curating is physically done in the communities from which the reporting takes place. Producing news on the scene makes the processes of production more transparent and de-emphasizes journalist-source disparities. Student reporters say this allows them to “reach those areas which the mainstream media prefers not to.”</p>\n<p>Taking away the physical newsroom has helped enable the creation of a much larger, global news operation. Initially a Los Angeles-based project, Pop-Up Newsroom has grown to include more than 200 students from universities and journalism training programs in seven countries (Armenia, Brazil, India, Netherlands, Taiwan, UK, and USA) who have collaboratively covered topics such as poverty, International Women’s Day, etc. Participants produce live mobile coverage about their local situation while sharing global curation responsibilities over a 24-hour period. Their coverage offers the public a mobile form of youth-produced news on the issues being covered. Mainstream media organizations such as <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/futureready-with-popup-newsroom/article5358774.ece\">The Hindu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/Students-experiment-in-pop-up-newsroom/2013/11/25/article1905014.ece\">The New Indian Express</a> and the social media platform <a href=\"https://blog.rebelmouse.com/students_across_the_world_use_-336290456.html\">RebelMouse</a> have highlighted the project.</p>\n<p>Freeing students from the structured newsroom encourages them to challenge traditional news conventions such as reliance on elite sources, which industrial news spaces have been designed to accommodate. Participants conceptualize their journalism roles less as “speaking for” citizens and, instead, “speaking with” them (Blumler and Coleman 2013, 183). Thus, students connect with a broader range of voices, rather than simply privileging traditional go-to sources. They amplify the personal stories recounted to them by ordinary citizens and members of traditionally marginalized groups. For example, Indian students covering poverty interviewed slum-dwellers, transgenders, and those forced into poverty due to caste discrimination. In the absence of bulky and intrusive media devices, these nontraditional sources opened up, allowing Pop-Up Newsroom to highlight stories typically invisible in mainstream news coverage. “Never before have I spent so much time listening to their stories,” one student said about her reporting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_bbUNv5klBfFL_i9S.png\" alt=\"Tweet about transgender advocacy\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “The questions that came to my mind were, ‘What the hell have I done for my society?

These interactions have ranged from the United Nations reposting students’ tweets from Chennai, to a low-income health clinic in Los Angeles and the students reporting from that location promoting each other on their Twitter accounts. Reflecting on this sort of engagement, a student said that before her Pop-Up experience, she had never reported with this “amount of involvement with the public. I both engaged communities and organizations.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_7YFgPEDvV9P3q0Rt.png\" alt=\"Tweet raising awareness about poverty\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_flFXX-FF8qFm_pZm.png\" alt=\"Student Journalism about Indian Slums\"></p>\n<p>The networked structure also meant students became connected to other Pop-Up Newsroom participants, which included anyone using the designated hashtag or sharing Pop-Up content, around the world. According to TweetReach, the hashtag#livepoverty reached 54,590 Twitter accounts over 48 hours; #IWDpopup reached 187,295 accounts. This shows that the project was bringing many more people into the conversation than the students themselves.</p>\n<p>Students also reported that seeing students in other countries covering the same topic broadened their views of the issues. For example, an Indian student reporting on<a href=\"http://t.co/ed7rlWsfTV\">poverty in slums around Chennai</a> was taken aback when a tweet from the United States deemed a woman deprived because she couldn’t afford a wedding dress. The student compared this with the Chennai’s poor struggling to afford two meals a day. Many American students had never heard of International Women’s Day, and were surprised to see the event was so well known in other parts of the world; the Dutch students posted about demonstrations spurred by the global day in their local community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Operating outside the usual boundaries of journalism, particularly those of a physically permanent newsroom, helped students exercise greater levels of independence and forced them to rely more on engagement with the communities they were reporting on to do their work. Embracing the power of networked communication helped them see their roles in civic life as interconnected with their sources and, at the same time, revealed the possibilities of global teamwork. Ultimately, Pop-Up Newsroom demonstrates ways even non-journalistic groups could create a social media powered pop-up project to both emancipate themselves as well as engage publics around important social issues.

For example, an Indian student reporting on[poverty in slums around Chennai](http://t.co/ed7rlWsfTV) was taken aback when a tweet from the United States deemed a woman deprived because she couldn’t afford a wedding dress. The student compared this with the Chennai’s poor struggling to afford two meals a day. Many American students had never heard of International Women’s Day, and were surprised to see the event was so well known in other parts of the world; the Dutch students posted about demonstrations spurred by the global day in their local community.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOperating outside the usual boundaries of journalism, particularly those of a physically permanent newsroom, helped students exercise greater levels of independence and forced them to rely more on engagement with the communities they were reporting on to do their work. Embracing the power of networked communication helped them see their roles in civic life as interconnected with their sources and, at the same time, revealed the possibilities of global teamwork. Ultimately, Pop-Up Newsroom demonstrates ways even non-journalistic groups could create a social media powered pop-up project to both emancipate themselves as well as engage publics around important social issues. As one student participant said, “Anyone with a smartphone can bring forth the condition of our society to public eyes.”\n\n# References\n\nBlumler, Jay and Stephen Coleman. “Comm Research — Views from Europe; Paradigms of Civic Communication.” _International Journal of Communication_ 7 (2013): 173–187.\n\nBruns, Axel. _Blogs.

Civic engagement entails strong links between online and offline interactions (Smith, 2013). However, finding the right knowledge and engaging contacts for effective local/regional knowledge sharing, participation and collaboration is a challenge. Public libraries can help society address this challenge, as, from repositories of books, they are rapidly becoming “public sensemakers” and “social innovation catalysts” (De Moor and Van den Assem, 2013). They are uniquely positioned for this role as they are trusted and rooted institutions with a mission to serve the common good by promoting education and media literacy for all.</p>\n<p>Still, to refocus their existing social capital, skills, and resources, libraries need to go through a significant transition. One state-of-the-art innovation, for example, are Library-Hack-Maker Spaces where public libraries become “community libraries”, capable of attracting, capturing, curating, and sharing local knowledge and know-how for mutual benefit, using typical hacker and maker spaces skills. Such spaces focus on catalyzing the production process of combining creative contributions of local users with a community lending and publishing platform (Naylor 2014). Another angle is the KnowledgeCloud concept being developed by the Dutch Tilburg public library. Its focus is to strengthen the fabric of knowledge interactions between stakeholders that make up regional society, providing context for and developing linkages between its constituting communities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_DVr6QNA2QhZ6E1f_.jpg\" alt=\"Fig.1: The KnowledgeCloud Architecture.

Each major release of this software has fostered further adoption by community access TV users and a new level of engagement with open source software. Drupal 5 was widely adopted as a solution for community access stations. Drupal 6 saw further custom development for community media specific functionality.

This collaboration’s aim was to further develop the project to align the principles of open source with the philosophy of community access. Participants challenge each other and themselves to be more than users and invest in a shared code base that is functional, feature rich, free and flexible. These stations are committed to openly sharing improvements, documentation, and problems with the community._\n\nPublic Access TV stations from around the United States have been utilizing Drupal as an open source platform since the release of Drupal 4.7 (1). Each major release of this software has fostered further adoption by community access TV users and a new level of engagement with open source software. Drupal 5 was widely adopted as a solution for community access stations. Drupal 6 saw further custom development for community media specific functionality. What distinguishes the community media activity on Drupal 7 and CiviCRM 4.x is due in part by the effort dubbed the CMDrupal project. This is an ongoing effort to merge the practice of nurturing an open source software ecosystem with the philosophy of organized community media.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_EGwkcAPN606JS9EN.jpg)\n\nThe Community Media Drupal Summit established a venue for web developers and community media practitioners to initiate open conversations around both the idea and implementation of a shared codebase. This group coalesced in March of 2012 in Austin, TX. Stefan Wray’s invitation email:\n\n_…A small group of community media centers’ decision makers and staff who deal with technology, along with Drupal developers working in this field, are gathering to discuss the status of our work in progress with the implementation of Drupal-based tools at our facilities, ways we can collaborate and share, and what we see as our future direction that is only limited by our imagination. The focus is to develop a culture of collaboration. (2)_\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_wM-hCdm0AF5K-JU6.png)\n\nThe work following the Channel Austin summit in 2012 has encouraged development and communication out in the open, establishing this project as a prerequisite to successful collaboration.\n\n&gt; &gt; The principles of transparency, empowerment and education in electronic media have long been a mainstay of the community access television philosophy. However, the practice of software development has not translated easily to community access television organizations that generally cling to rigidly defined technical roles from a pre-internet age.\n\nFrom 2012 through the summer of 2014 three different Starter Kits, or stand alone installation profiles are actively being developed upon Drupal 7 and CiviCRM — identified distinctly as Easy, Moderate and Difficult Kits. The intended workflow is to transition an organization’s website to an Easy Kit and as time and skills develop migrate to a Moderate with CiviCRM member database, and finally work with a developer to configure modules and features of the Difficult kit. Some of the functionality in the Easy Kit is as follows:\n\n-   Checklist to walk you through the initial configuration\n\n-   Adaptive theme that works well for mobile users\n\n-   Front page Slideshow\n\n-   RSS Feed driven Video on Demand Library\n\n-   RSS Feed driven Airing Schedule\n\n-   Legal (to manage member behavior and replace cablecast agreements)\n\n-   Manage Permissions for Staff, Members, and Administrators\n\n-   Online Show Submissions (replace paper forms)\n\n-   Webforms (replace other paper forms)\n\n-   Captcha and Badbot to block spam (3)\n\nOrganizations who have taken the task of investing in this software project are learning how to collaborate openly in this space.

Activists compile live maps based on witness reports to create, distribute and improve shared situational awareness. Dozens of live maps (powered by the Ushahidi platform) were created to monitor the events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria and Yemen (Meier 2011). This increasing use of live maps points to the possible rise of a “mapping reflex,” ascribing to each event not only sounds and images, but also a concrete geographic location (Sidorenko 2011).

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaef95172290686e460d6e"},"enabled":true,"title":"Community Radio as Civic Media: The case of Radio al-Balad 92.4FM in Amman, Jordan\n","body":{"html":"<h3 id=\"gretchen-king-mcgill-university\">Gretchen King (McGill University)</h3>\n<p>In 2000, Jordan’s first community radio station Radio al-Balad 92.4FM emerged to break the government’s monopoly over local media by launching <a href=\"http://ar.ammannet.net/\">AmmanNet.net</a> to produce community news content for Internet distribution and broadcast on nearby FM stations in Palestine (Aqrabawi et al. 2006). After receiving a radio license in 2005, AmmanNet began broadcasting on the FM dial reaching listeners throughout the greater Amman area (or over two-million people). The station fulfills a mandate to provide radio production skills to those who have limited access to media or other resources to address social, economic, or political problems (Pintak 2007). By 2008, the station re-branded itself as <a href=\"http://balad.fm/\">Radio al-Balad 92.4FM</a> — Saut al-nas wa al-balad or voice of the people and the community (MP3, Arabic).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ySpyPGZH4HRXI0a0hEVlctOUU/edit\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ySpyPGZH4HRXI0a0hEVlctOUU/edit</a></p>\n<p>Today, Radio al-Balad 92.4FM is part of a growing network of community media institutions that have been established in the Middle East and North Africa region throughout the last decade with many new stations opening through initiatives like Aswatona (2014). As non-profit and participatory media institutions, community media are largely volunteer-run and provide a service to a specific community. While the structure of community media institutions is determined by local realities including regulatory, legal, and economic environments (Coyer 2011); community radio stations worldwide generally have a similar mission, but can vary greatly in governance practices (Buckley et al. 2008). Among media institutions, community radio stations are unique in their charters in that they are guided by participatory values promoting citizen empowerment in their work towards democratizing local media and politics (Gumucio Dagron 2001; Rodriguez 2001; AMARC 2003). Over two decades ago, Bruce Girard, co-founder of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (known by its French acronym AMARC), which today brings together a network of more than 4,000 community radios, federations, and civic media stakeholders in more than 130 countries, identified community radio’s “commitment to community participation at all levels” (Girard 1992, 2).</p>\n<p>The impact of this mission has been the focus of the first extensive study of community radio audiences in the Middle East, which draws on ethnographic techniques that include participant observation, interviews, storytelling, and focus groups to produce qualitative and applied audience research (King n.d.). Ten hours of listener generated data gathered in Amman over five weeks illustrate how Radio al-Balad 92.4FM achieves their mandate to serve the needs of citizens. Extending this research to build on the history of community radio as a civic technology promoting participatory media access and social change (Huesca 1995; Fairchild 2001), this case study demonstrates how community radio offers citizens a transformative experience by cultivating media literacy, raising civic awareness, and revealing opportunities for collective action and social change.</p>\n<p>Community radio stations, like Radio al-Balad 92.4FM, aim to make media accessible and participatory. Radio al-Balad 92.4FM achieves this by providing regular opportunities for citizens to acquire skills in radio production. One listener and new volunteer shared her first experience producing a multimedia program for distribution by Radio al-Balad online and over 92.4FM:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “Practically, I am a human rights journalist who works in the written medium, but after I saw the effect of the audio and video reports this made me realize who the eye or ear respond differently to written content versus audio and video. The other thing was to be able to approach subjects from a purely rights perspectives, while not being under the umbrella of someone like the United Nations, or another umbrella that deals exclusively with human rights; to be able to do so at a local radio station, that was something ground-breaking. This gave me courage in proposing questions and stories. They told me, the ceiling is as high as I am comfortable setting it.

After receiving a radio license in 2005, AmmanNet began broadcasting on the FM dial reaching listeners throughout the greater Amman area (or over two-million people). The station fulfills a mandate to provide radio production skills to those who have limited access to media or other resources to address social, economic, or political problems (Pintak 2007). By 2008, the station re-branded itself as [Radio al-Balad 92.4FM](http://balad.fm/) — Saut al-nas wa al-balad or voice of the people and the community (MP3, Arabic).\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ySpyPGZH4HRXI0a0hEVlctOUU/edit\n\nToday, Radio al-Balad 92.4FM is part of a growing network of community media institutions that have been established in the Middle East and North Africa region throughout the last decade with many new stations opening through initiatives like Aswatona (2014). As non-profit and participatory media institutions, community media are largely volunteer-run and provide a service to a specific community. While the structure of community media institutions is determined by local realities including regulatory, legal, and economic environments (Coyer 2011); community radio stations worldwide generally have a similar mission, but can vary greatly in governance practices (Buckley et al. 2008). Among media institutions, community radio stations are unique in their charters in that they are guided by participatory values promoting citizen empowerment in their work towards democratizing local media and politics (Gumucio Dagron 2001; Rodriguez 2001; AMARC 2003). Over two decades ago, Bruce Girard, co-founder of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (known by its French acronym AMARC), which today brings together a network of more than 4,000 community radios, federations, and civic media stakeholders in more than 130 countries, identified community radio’s “commitment to community participation at all levels” (Girard 1992, 2).\n\nThe impact of this mission has been the focus of the first extensive study of community radio audiences in the Middle East, which draws on ethnographic techniques that include participant observation, interviews, storytelling, and focus groups to produce qualitative and applied audience research (King n.d.). Ten hours of listener generated data gathered in Amman over five weeks illustrate how Radio al-Balad 92.4FM achieves their mandate to serve the needs of citizens. Extending this research to build on the history of community radio as a civic technology promoting participatory media access and social change (Huesca 1995; Fairchild 2001), this case study demonstrates how community radio offers citizens a transformative experience by cultivating media literacy, raising civic awareness, and revealing opportunities for collective action and social change.\n\nCommunity radio stations, like Radio al-Balad 92.4FM, aim to make media accessible and participatory. Radio al-Balad 92.4FM achieves this by providing regular opportunities for citizens to acquire skills in radio production. One listener and new volunteer shared her first experience producing a multimedia program for distribution by Radio al-Balad online and over 92.4FM:\n\n&gt; &gt; “Practically, I am a human rights journalist who works in the written medium, but after I saw the effect of the audio and video reports this made me realize who the eye or ear respond differently to written content versus audio and video. The other thing was to be able to approach subjects from a purely rights perspectives, while not being under the umbrella of someone like the United Nations, or another umbrella that deals exclusively with human rights; to be able to do so at a local radio station, that was something ground-breaking. This gave me courage in proposing questions and stories. They told me, the ceiling is as high as I am comfortable setting it. So we produced the content with all positions, we brought the government opinion, the human rights opinion, the opinion of people on the street, and the voice of unions. It was beautiful experience.”\n\n&gt; &gt; By broadcasting programming focusing on civic freedoms and human rights, Radio al-Balad 92.4FM facilitates political learning environments.\n\nPrograms like the popular [Nas ou nas show](http://ar.ammannet.net/documentary/), covering human rights news in Jordan, places Radio al-Balad 92.4FM, according to one listener, “at the forefront of political and social education in Amman.” Other programs promote media literacy by offering a critical view of the political economy of Jordan’s media landscape, as in the weekly show [Ain al E’lam or Eye on the Media](http://www.eyeonmediajo.net/).\n\nAccessing a free space for expression and media production offers citizens not only new forms of participation and education, but also extends new opportunities for engaging in collective action. Over 300 audience members have participated in meetings of the Listeners’ Club at Radio al-Balad 92.4FM.

This application was developed in response to massive falsifications during legislative elections of December 2011, in order to prepare, educate and arm new independent observers for Presidential elections, which took place on the 4th of March 2012.</p>\n<p>The idea of WebNabludatel was first publicly expressed on the 22nd of December 2011 on <a href=\"http://habrahabr.ru/post/135108/\">Habrahabr</a>, the most popular Russian collaborative blog of developers and IT specialists, when Ilya Segalovitch, ex-CTO of <a href=\"http://www.yandex.ru/\">Yandex</a> proposed an idea of creating a mobile “observer’s digital diary.” This diary would help observers with surveying the voting process and documenting fraud. The post was seen 1709 times, liked 117 times and commented 398 times, with lots of proposals from developers and UI designers giving first spontaneous ideas of application architecture and menu. Four days later a young programmer and entrepreneur, CTO of a well-known Russian IT-company “<a href=\"http://progress-engine.ru/\">Progress Engine</a>” Alexey Poimtsev creates a Google group dedicated to this “electronic diary” project, inviting “any developers using Ruby on Rails” to collaborate with him. In few days, front-end developers for Android an iOS mobile app are found, the tasks are distributed and an open code repository is created on GitHub. The work took 1 month and a half and the total cost of the project was only 200 dollars, with members of the team investing their own money to pay for hosting and servers. In total, 17 persons worked on the development of the application. The code of the application is open and available at <a href=\"\">GitHub</a>. The whole story of WebNabludatel’s creation can be characterized in terms of “stigmergic collaboration”, described by several scholars as one of the main mechanisms of self-organization within open-source and “civic hacking” communities based on indirect incentives (“artefacts”) and mutual aid (Heylighen 2007; Eliott 2006; Robles and al. 2005).</p>\n<p>Apart from technical expertise, legal competences were required to build this application in accordance with the law and with observers’ experience. That is why the team collaborated with two NGOs “<a href=\"http://www.golos.org/\">Golos</a>” and “<a href=\"http://nabludatel.org/\">Grazhdanin Nabludatel</a>,” both specialized in defending voters’ rights and preparing observers for the elections. The application had to be not only technically efficient, but also based on a solid legal ground. Developed by a hybrid team of technical and legal experts and activists, WebNabludatel is a <em>techno-juridical</em> instrument (Contini and Lanzara 2008) with legal code being translated into programming code, and rules and norms of electoral procedures inscribed into the interface of the application.</p>\n<p>Though, to be translatable into a mobile interface, legal norms had to be <em>functionally simplified</em>. So, the UI designers worked with lawyers from “Golos” to adapt several hundreds of pages of electoral code and “cut” the observation practice on major steps. These steps are represented in the menu of the app in a chronological order, guiding the user throughout the elections day: from checking empty urns early in the morning to counting bulletins and signing protocols during the night after the elections. Every step has been translated into a simple question with only “yes/no/no information” answers possible. This standardization of observers practice, allows an automatic treatment of the whole volume of gathered data, and a representation of this data according to the type of fraud, location and other criteria. This standardization by design has, we argue, a certain “multiplication” effect (Ermoshina, 2014): it helps to transform individual observers’ experiences into parts of a bigger movement of building crowdsourced proofs database of elections illegitimacy.</p>\n<p>An observer and user of WebNabludatel, shares her user experience of the app:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“The observer’s guide was very well done, structured as a sequences of questions. For example, the voting starts — what should I observe? I must verify that the voting boxes are empty and properly closed, that all observers are registered and so on. You only put yes or no, it is useful as it helps you stay concentrated  I remember when at the end of the day women from electoral commission started shaking the voting box, turning it upside down before opening it, I knew it was illegal, and I fixed and filmed it with my app. But the app can’t do anything when the fraud is happening outside of the polling station, when people vote at their places. In my case, it was the major problem, and we could not film or fix it with the app.”</em></p>\n<p>So, even if the app is useful to fix visible fraud, it can not really prevent or control everything. It is first of all conceived to organize observer’s activity, instruct and empower him legally.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_3F3YWfe4z5jD-rvq.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the application with questions: “Information on candidates is correctly provided” (yes/no), “The pattern of a bulletin available” (yes/no), “Bigger version of protocol available”, “Propaganda materials closer than 50 meters from polling station”.

An SOS-button was equally integrated into the interface, giving observers a possibility to ask for lawyers’ help in one click, in case of aggression or illegal expulsion from the polling station.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Taking into consideration the absence of Wi-Fi (or its intentional blockage) on many polling stations, the app has been made totally independent from the Internet: the inner memory of the app allows a user to fulfill the check-list and stocks all the data until he finds a place with a good connection.</p>\n<p>The application was used by 6197 persons during the presidential elections of the 4th of March 2012, 11709 frauds were registered, classified and geolocated.

It attempts to give citizens a technical instrument of crowdsourced surveillance and collective control over governments, transforming users into “participatory sensors” (Goodchild 2007; Boulos 2011) by cutting a global problem, that of illegitimacy of elections, into micro tasks and steps. The application aims at democratizing observers’ skills and expertise by incorporating them into a simple and easy-to-use app, giving equal access to the procedure of observation to all users condition considered by Michel Callon as one of the basic features of technical democracy (Callon and al. 2009).</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Boulos Kamel, B.

Developed by a hybrid team of technical and legal experts and activists, WebNabludatel is a _techno-juridical_ instrument (Contini and Lanzara 2008) with legal code being translated into programming code, and rules and norms of electoral procedures inscribed into the interface of the application.\n\nThough, to be translatable into a mobile interface, legal norms had to be _functionally simplified_. So, the UI designers worked with lawyers from “Golos” to adapt several hundreds of pages of electoral code and “cut” the observation practice on major steps. These steps are represented in the menu of the app in a chronological order, guiding the user throughout the elections day: from checking empty urns early in the morning to counting bulletins and signing protocols during the night after the elections. Every step has been translated into a simple question with only “yes/no/no information” answers possible. This standardization of observers practice, allows an automatic treatment of the whole volume of gathered data, and a representation of this data according to the type of fraud, location and other criteria. This standardization by design has, we argue, a certain “multiplication” effect (Ermoshina, 2014): it helps to transform individual observers’ experiences into parts of a bigger movement of building crowdsourced proofs database of elections illegitimacy.\n\nAn observer and user of WebNabludatel, shares her user experience of the app:\n\n&gt; &gt; _“The observer’s guide was very well done, structured as a sequences of questions. For example, the voting starts — what should I observe? I must verify that the voting boxes are empty and properly closed, that all observers are registered and so on. You only put yes or no, it is useful as it helps you stay concentrated  I remember when at the end of the day women from electoral commission started shaking the voting box, turning it upside down before opening it, I knew it was illegal, and I fixed and filmed it with my app. But the app can’t do anything when the fraud is happening outside of the polling station, when people vote at their places. In my case, it was the major problem, and we could not film or fix it with the app.”_\n\nSo, even if the app is useful to fix visible fraud, it can not really prevent or control everything. It is first of all conceived to organize observer’s activity, instruct and empower him legally.\n\n![Screenshot of the application with questions: “Information on candidates is correctly provided” (yes/no), “The pattern of a bulletin available” (yes/no), “Bigger version of protocol available”, “Propaganda materials closer than 50 meters from polling station”.

Provided by WN team](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OzNXtzoju1oT2_pT.png)\n\nMobile technology plays here a crucial part, as it comes in response to a specific user experience: need for immediate reaction, simplified and structured information available “at hand,” geolocation function that helps to map data, photo and video features to document the event. An SOS-button was equally integrated into the interface, giving observers a possibility to ask for lawyers’ help in one click, in case of aggression or illegal expulsion from the polling station.\n\n&gt; &gt; Taking into consideration the absence of Wi-Fi (or its intentional blockage) on many polling stations, the app has been made totally independent from the Internet: the inner memory of the app allows a user to fulfill the check-list and stocks all the data until he finds a place with a good connection.\n\nThe application was used by 6197 persons during the presidential elections of the 4th of March 2012, 11709 frauds were registered, classified and geolocated. According to these data “Golos” started legal proceedings against some of the falsificators.\n\n![Statistics in different regions of Russia, screenshot provided by WN team](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_vDu8LTnSNtvDcpgZ.png)\n\nThe application had a certain international success, winning the German “Deutsche Welle Blog Awards” with 549 voices as the “best usage of technologies for social good.” The code source of the app was reused by Ukrainian and Moldavian activists.\n\nWebNabludatel app, in the context of distrust of Russian citizens towards traditional political institutions, can be considered as an instrument of counter-democracy, as described by Rosanvallon (2008). It attempts to give citizens a technical instrument of crowdsourced surveillance and collective control over governments, transforming users into “participatory sensors” (Goodchild 2007; Boulos 2011) by cutting a global problem, that of illegitimacy of elections, into micro tasks and steps. The application aims at democratizing observers’ skills and expertise by incorporating them into a simple and easy-to-use app, giving equal access to the procedure of observation to all users condition considered by Michel Callon as one of the basic features of technical democracy (Callon and al. 2009).\n\n# References\n\nBoulos Kamel, B.

Nowhere was a solutionistic air more on display than the particular National Day of Civic Hacking event that I attended in New York City in 2013. This particular hackathon was dedicated to addressing the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, specifically the question of how preparation as well as cleanup might have been improved by potential technological intervention. Organized by local victims — both technically-skilled and not — this event drew upwards of 100 people at its peak, many of whom were simply curious to see what a civic hackathon might be like.

There was little discussion or negotiation beyond the initial sharing period; rather, what quickly came to dominate the room was the competitive feeling of a charrette as the minutes began to tick away. The end of the day resulted in a presentation of six projects (in various states of completion).

Twenty years of continued violent conflict has left a legacy of destruction, crumbling infrastructure and a lack of formal government institutions. This absence of regulation has also given rise to the piracy, shadow networks, and vibrant trade that have become characteristic of Somalia’s surprisingly functional informal economy. Despite significant interventions and efforts by the international community, and the UN in particular, to create and implement structures of governance, from the presidency to the army, most initiatives remain largely symbolic. The Federal Government’s authority does not extend far beyond the capital city of Mogadishu with the rest of the Somali territories controlled and governed by a patchwork of forces. These groups include the al-Qaeda allied Islamist group Al Shabaab in South-Central Somalia, the self-governing state of Puntland, and its northern neighbor, Somaliland, which is actively seeking independence partly by virtue that it has its own governance institutions and is largely stable, peaceful and relatively democratic.</p>\n<p>In this varied political and economic context there has been a fascinating experiment — the growth of a vibrant Information Communications Technology (ICT) sector despite the absence of a legal and regulatory environment, and without the state institutions that would normally support the development of such media (Stremlau 159–174). The growth of this sector has leveraged social networks, particularly with the diaspora, and has helped develop services that would normally be provided by the government or formal institutions. Private companies have proliferated, providing telecommunications and Internet infrastructure and creating products uniquely suited to the Somali context. Given the complexity of operating in such a varied political environment, and with pressing security concerns, investment has been almost exclusively led by Somalis, both from the Diaspora and within the country. This is a substantially different environment than telecommunications in countries across the rest of the continent, which have been dominated by multi-national companies such as India’s Bharti Telecom or France’s Orange.</p>\n<p>While many parts of the ICT sector have experienced significant growth, from phone in radio shows to internet cafes, one of the most innovative platforms to emerge has been mobile money, a service that is accessible through mobile phones and allows customers to send and receive money, or even in the case of Somaliland, hold money in e-wallets. Kenya has the most vibrant mobile money market on the planet <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Telesom-Somaliland.pdf\">with almost 70% of adults using their mobiles for payments</a> while Somalia, and Uganda, are close behind. Mobile money has become a crucial tool for poor people that do not have access to a bank account and are excluded from the global and national economy (Penicaud, Claire &amp; Fionan McGrath, 2013).</p>\n<p>With the proliferation of cell phones in Somalia and across the continent, mobile money has become an important tool for civic engagement. The study of civic media, which looks at citizen involvement through new forms of technology and media, has tended to overlook what media usage looks like in informal, and often highly unstable contexts. Cell phones in Somalia are a way to manage finances, connect with community and access information. Similar to the well-known MPesa in neighboring Kenya, mobile money in Somalia has grown to occupy a central role in increasing citizen participation and inclusion in the local and international economy. It has, however, taken on very local characteristics and has also adapted to the particularities of the Somali context.</p>\n<p>Somalia may lack a formal banking system but the dynamic hawalah (money transfer) system that has developed provides many financial services, including facilitating the flow of an estimated 1.6 billion USD in remittances from the diaspora, making this one of the most important contributors to the country’s GDP. The remittance industry, in partnership with a relatively inexpensive yet strong telecommunications network, much of which they own, has encouraged the growth of the mobile money sector. Hormuud, known as Telesom in Somaliland and as Golis Telecom in Puntland, has the market share through Zaad payment system, which allows users to pay for items in shops (including informal markets), transfer money and pay bills. It has even been adopted by some institutions to manage payrolls; for example Amoud University, one of Somaliland’s leading universities, not only accepts course fees using mobile phone payments but also pays its hundreds of employees using Zaad.</p>\n<p>Zaad’s more comprehensive approach to mobile money and banking has, along with its competitors, both contemporary and aspirational, encouraged the move to a more cashless economy. While MPesa has tended to focus on person-to-person payments, mobile money in Somalia has filled a more traditional banking need. Somalis use mobile money as e-wallets, holding money in the system and saving it securely for larger purchases or transfers, in essence acting as a bank account. It has been further adapted to the Somali context in that it is free for all users, in contrast with other mobile money companies that are more commonly fee based. Furthermore, mobile money in Somalia functions in USD rather than Somali (or Somaliland) shillings, the effects of which are not always considered positive. While USD has always been a major currency in the Somali territories, its growing use through Zaad has also been seen to encourage inflation and penalize civil servants who are among those primarily paid in local currency.</p>\n<p>The growth of mobile money has been completely reliant on local dispute resolution mechanisms, including customary or xeer law and networks of trust, which have both helped facilitate and support the remittance industry. This more bottom-up approach to innovation, whereby technology has succeeded in starting to address challenges of everyday governance and service delivery is also an important lesson for the importance of taking a context-based approach to understanding innovation and the potential of new technologies to engage marginalized communities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook, ‘Somalia country page,’ the Central Intelligence Agency, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html\">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html</a></p>\n<p>Iazzolino, Gianluca. 2014. “Somaliland has embraced mobile money — but at what price?” <em>The Guardian Online</em>, May 19. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/19/somaliland-mobile-money-zaad-inflation-economy-banking-remittance.\">http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/19/somaliland-mobile-money-zaad-inflation-economy-banking-remittance.</a></p>\n<p>Penicaud, Claire and Fionan McGrath. 2013. “Innovative inclusion: How Telesom ZAAD brought mobile money to Somaliland.” <em>Mobile money for the unbanked</em>.</p>\n<p>Stremlau, Nicole. 2013. “Somalia media law in the absence of a state.” <em>Journal of Media and Cultural Politics</em> 8(2): 159–174.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

These groups include the al-Qaeda allied Islamist group Al Shabaab in South-Central Somalia, the self-governing state of Puntland, and its northern neighbor, Somaliland, which is actively seeking independence partly by virtue that it has its own governance institutions and is largely stable, peaceful and relatively democratic.\n\nIn this varied political and economic context there has been a fascinating experiment — the growth of a vibrant Information Communications Technology (ICT) sector despite the absence of a legal and regulatory environment, and without the state institutions that would normally support the development of such media (Stremlau 159–174). The growth of this sector has leveraged social networks, particularly with the diaspora, and has helped develop services that would normally be provided by the government or formal institutions. Private companies have proliferated, providing telecommunications and Internet infrastructure and creating products uniquely suited to the Somali context. Given the complexity of operating in such a varied political environment, and with pressing security concerns, investment has been almost exclusively led by Somalis, both from the Diaspora and within the country. This is a substantially different environment than telecommunications in countries across the rest of the continent, which have been dominated by multi-national companies such as India’s Bharti Telecom or France’s Orange.\n\nWhile many parts of the ICT sector have experienced significant growth, from phone in radio shows to internet cafes, one of the most innovative platforms to emerge has been mobile money, a service that is accessible through mobile phones and allows customers to send and receive money, or even in the case of Somaliland, hold money in e-wallets. Kenya has the most vibrant mobile money market on the planet [with almost 70% of adults using their mobiles for payments](http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Telesom-Somaliland.pdf) while Somalia, and Uganda, are close behind. Mobile money has become a crucial tool for poor people that do not have access to a bank account and are excluded from the global and national economy (Penicaud, Claire &amp; Fionan McGrath, 2013).\n\nWith the proliferation of cell phones in Somalia and across the continent, mobile money has become an important tool for civic engagement. The study of civic media, which looks at citizen involvement through new forms of technology and media, has tended to overlook what media usage looks like in informal, and often highly unstable contexts. Cell phones in Somalia are a way to manage finances, connect with community and access information. Similar to the well-known MPesa in neighboring Kenya, mobile money in Somalia has grown to occupy a central role in increasing citizen participation and inclusion in the local and international economy. It has, however, taken on very local characteristics and has also adapted to the particularities of the Somali context.\n\nSomalia may lack a formal banking system but the dynamic hawalah (money transfer) system that has developed provides many financial services, including facilitating the flow of an estimated 1.6 billion USD in remittances from the diaspora, making this one of the most important contributors to the country’s GDP. The remittance industry, in partnership with a relatively inexpensive yet strong telecommunications network, much of which they own, has encouraged the growth of the mobile money sector. Hormuud, known as Telesom in Somaliland and as Golis Telecom in Puntland, has the market share through Zaad payment system, which allows users to pay for items in shops (including informal markets), transfer money and pay bills. It has even been adopted by some institutions to manage payrolls; for example Amoud University, one of Somaliland’s leading universities, not only accepts course fees using mobile phone payments but also pays its hundreds of employees using Zaad.\n\nZaad’s more comprehensive approach to mobile money and banking has, along with its competitors, both contemporary and aspirational, encouraged the move to a more cashless economy. While MPesa has tended to focus on person-to-person payments, mobile money in Somalia has filled a more traditional banking need. Somalis use mobile money as e-wallets, holding money in the system and saving it securely for larger purchases or transfers, in essence acting as a bank account. It has been further adapted to the Somali context in that it is free for all users, in contrast with other mobile money companies that are more commonly fee based. Furthermore, mobile money in Somalia functions in USD rather than Somali (or Somaliland) shillings, the effects of which are not always considered positive. While USD has always been a major currency in the Somali territories, its growing use through Zaad has also been seen to encourage inflation and penalize civil servants who are among those primarily paid in local currency.\n\nThe growth of mobile money has been completely reliant on local dispute resolution mechanisms, including customary or xeer law and networks of trust, which have both helped facilitate and support the remittance industry. This more bottom-up approach to innovation, whereby technology has succeeded in starting to address challenges of everyday governance and service delivery is also an important lesson for the importance of taking a context-based approach to understanding innovation and the potential of new technologies to engage marginalized communities.\n\n# References\n\nThe CIA World Factbook, ‘Somalia country page,’ the Central Intelligence Agency, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html)\n\nIazzolino, Gianluca. 2014. “Somaliland has embraced mobile money — but at what price?” _The Guardian Online_, May 19.

Moscow, July 2012. Credit: Igor Ponosov. Several key lessons emerged across the iterations of the public mailboxes:\nCo-operation to support local agency: Mailboxes potentially serve as devices for generating site-specific civic dialogue (including gathering complaints, suggestions, and ideas). But this can only be initiated and sustained with active participation and ownership by local organizers and residents throughout the design phase of the project: scouting locations, installing/maintaining mailboxes, defining questions, and reading or responding to letters. A forum for interaction beyond the mailboxes (via meetings or online engagement) is also crucial.\"></p>\n<p>Communication and transparency with participants: Participants that submit letters to the mailboxes deserve a meaningful outcome, whether a phone call or letter to keep them engaged, even if the issue remains unresolved. The timeliness and positive tone of language used in such correspondences can make a project feel more relevant and inclusive.</p>\n<p>Physical location of interventions matter: Mailboxes are suited to outdoor public spaces. However, tactically choosing the right locations and caretakers is crucial. It is important to remain flexible yet engaged at the same time, regarding the goals and outcomes to allow the community to direct how the mailboxes may best serve their needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"networked-modes-for-mobilizing-collective-urban-action\">Networked Modes for Mobilizing Collective Urban Action</h1>\n<p>While deploying the mailboxes across Moscow, it became evident that scaling the project and engaging participants more widely could be better supported through an online platform. Workshop participants at Strelka, including designers, developers, and community activists, developed a rapid prototype called synchroniCITY (Figures 3 and 5). It was designed to complement the mailboxes with written suggestions re-posted online by local volunteers, while some users could directly submit ideas for neighborhood improvement there. It was tested with local activists and residents in Troparevo-Nikulino (Figure 4) who were using the mailboxes to offer urban planning suggestions; their feedback helped the team refine the design for future use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_f7LqyaMyulYMOF9M0jMOmg.png\" alt=\"Figure 3: The original prototype platform, SynchroniCITY, emerged based on a workshop at the Strelka Institute in July 2012.

These would be created by residents as small, everyday acts of creative intervention with civic potential, and later aggregated into localized forms of collective action or sustainable living (de Klerk, Sawhney, and Malhotra, forthcoming).</p>\n<p>With this framework in mind, the design team developed a new platform (<a href=\"http://www.MicroAct.org\">www.MicroAct.org</a>), centered on MicroActs that embody both issues and emerging solutions. The site allows users to post illustrative examples of useful actions, and tag, categorize or aggregate them into campaigns for extended advocacy among collectives. Others may replicate these MicroActs and devise new design iterations localized to their context of use, with all instantiations archived on the site. For example, a collective of cycling activists may document the design of hand-made signs and illuminated cycling paths that support safe riding in neighborhoods, while residents in other districts may repurpose or share their own design iterations. An aggregation of such MicroActs may gradually become part of a grassroots campaign around cycling advocacy in the city.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nwGynrY4I200GV3sCI9zJg.png\" alt=\"Figure 6: The newly designed MicroAct platform with user-generated posts organized in categories.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_FA2qbjjUgT1MG3mwhzskKw.png\" alt=\"Figure 7: Mobile version of the MicroAct site showing how posts can be replicated and extended.\"></p>\n<p>The MicroAct platform has been designed with a simple and multi-lingual user interface, for use as a web-based and mobile application (Figures 6 and 7). While the platform continues to be developed, it is being tested with participants through ongoing workshops and can be used in conjunction with mailboxes installed in neighborhoods (which are a form of MicroActs themselves). The MicroAct platform and the public mailboxes explore forms of DIY Urbanism through networked and place-based self-organization, co-design and sharing. The challenge is to facilitate not only resident-led action, but also create a productive dialogue between residents and municipal actors, while fostering more inclusive and sustained modes of civic engagement.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

However, supporting residents to take ownership and collective, creative actions to change their urban environments remained a challenge.\n\n![Figure 2: Mailbox installed with the public library in Chistie Prudie. Moscow, July 2012. Credit: Igor Ponosov. Several key lessons emerged across the iterations of the public mailboxes:\nCo-operation to support local agency: Mailboxes potentially serve as devices for generating site-specific civic dialogue (including gathering complaints, suggestions, and ideas). But this can only be initiated and sustained with active participation and ownership by local organizers and residents throughout the design phase of the project: scouting locations, installing/maintaining mailboxes, defining questions, and reading or responding to letters. A forum for interaction beyond the mailboxes (via meetings or online engagement) is also crucial.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_WnHxAdFibEncehHBCuZSBg.jpeg)\n\nCommunication and transparency with participants: Participants that submit letters to the mailboxes deserve a meaningful outcome, whether a phone call or letter to keep them engaged, even if the issue remains unresolved. The timeliness and positive tone of language used in such correspondences can make a project feel more relevant and inclusive.\n\nPhysical location of interventions matter: Mailboxes are suited to outdoor public spaces. However, tactically choosing the right locations and caretakers is crucial. It is important to remain flexible yet engaged at the same time, regarding the goals and outcomes to allow the community to direct how the mailboxes may best serve their needs.\n\n# Networked Modes for Mobilizing Collective Urban Action\n\nWhile deploying the mailboxes across Moscow, it became evident that scaling the project and engaging participants more widely could be better supported through an online platform. Workshop participants at Strelka, including designers, developers, and community activists, developed a rapid prototype called synchroniCITY (Figures 3 and 5). It was designed to complement the mailboxes with written suggestions re-posted online by local volunteers, while some users could directly submit ideas for neighborhood improvement there. It was tested with local activists and residents in Troparevo-Nikulino (Figure 4) who were using the mailboxes to offer urban planning suggestions; their feedback helped the team refine the design for future use.\n\n![Figure 3: The original prototype platform, SynchroniCITY, emerged based on a workshop at the Strelka Institute in July 2012. It was co-designed and tested with local activists in Troparevo-Nikulino.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_f7LqyaMyulYMOF9M0jMOmg.png)\n\n![Figure 4: Residents in Troparevo-Nikulino providing feedback on the first prototype of SynchroniCITY.

These would be created by residents as small, everyday acts of creative intervention with civic potential, and later aggregated into localized forms of collective action or sustainable living (de Klerk, Sawhney, and Malhotra, forthcoming).\n\nWith this framework in mind, the design team developed a new platform (www.MicroAct.org), centered on MicroActs that embody both issues and emerging solutions. The site allows users to post illustrative examples of useful actions, and tag, categorize or aggregate them into campaigns for extended advocacy among collectives. Others may replicate these MicroActs and devise new design iterations localized to their context of use, with all instantiations archived on the site. For example, a collective of cycling activists may document the design of hand-made signs and illuminated cycling paths that support safe riding in neighborhoods, while residents in other districts may repurpose or share their own design iterations. An aggregation of such MicroActs may gradually become part of a grassroots campaign around cycling advocacy in the city.\n\n![Figure 6: The newly designed MicroAct platform with user-generated posts organized in categories.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nwGynrY4I200GV3sCI9zJg.png)\n\n![Figure 7: Mobile version of the MicroAct site showing how posts can be replicated and extended.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_FA2qbjjUgT1MG3mwhzskKw.png)\n\nThe MicroAct platform has been designed with a simple and multi-lingual user interface, for use as a web-based and mobile application (Figures 6 and 7). While the platform continues to be developed, it is being tested with participants through ongoing workshops and can be used in conjunction with mailboxes installed in neighborhoods (which are a form of MicroActs themselves). The MicroAct platform and the public mailboxes explore forms of DIY Urbanism through networked and place-based self-organization, co-design and sharing. The challenge is to facilitate not only resident-led action, but also create a productive dialogue between residents and municipal actors, while fostering more inclusive and sustained modes of civic engagement.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

In recent years, cities have embraced the idea that they are platforms for the exchange of big data, laboratories for urban experiments, and spaces of civic hacking. These activities raise questions about the nature of civic engagement as well as the embedded values that inhabit civic media infrastructures in cities. While many of these activities have been focused on designing solutions to urban problems, others aim to raise new questions by mobilizing the lived experiences of citizens around specific matters of concern and alternative possible futures.</p>\n<p>This case discusses the processes and tools created through a yearlong research project called “Designing Policy,” which included a series of workshops and a visual toolkit (can be downloaded <a href=\"http://designingpolicytoolkit.org/\">here</a>). The project wajs conducted in 2012–2013, in collaboration with Anijo Mathew at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology, and with funding from the Urban Communication Foundation. The workshops focused on a particular subset of civic media; namely, urban technologies, which are composed of the digital and material communication, and information infrastructures of cities (Foth et al. 2011). Urban environments are populated by an increasing number of technological residents such as LED screens that animate building facades, so-called ‘smart’ parking meters, and adaptive traffic signals as well as the millions of networked devices that people carry around on their bodies and bicycles as well as in their cars.</p>\n<p>These new urban citizens with which we share our spaces and delegate our decisions are not well understood (Latour 1992). This is because the technologies (as well as the data that they collect) are often proprietary ‘black boxes,’ and the political decisions that result in their widespread appropriation and deployment take place within obscure government departments. The goal of the Designing Policy project was to open up the black box of urban technology as a site for the discussion of values (Nissenbaum 2001) and ethics, as well as to illustrate the ways in which urban technology systems might be designed around alternative framings and questions.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The purpose of the design workshops and the visual toolkit was to interest participants from a broad range of backgrounds and expertise in thinking about urban technology as a site of intervention in public policy decisions and as a site where cities (and their politics) are made.</p>\n<p>Specifically, given widespread interest in the use of big data and the ‘internet of things’ for the purpose of tracking and monitoring people as well as delivering city services, the workshops sought to increase awareness of the ways in which urban technologies mediate the relationships between citizens and policymakers around important issues; issues that are often defined in a top-down manner by policymakers such as privacy, security, efficiency, and innovation. At the same time, the workshops were intended to open up urban technologies as sites of experimentation and generative engagements that map onto the everyday lives of citizens — which include a deeper, messier, more nuanced and bottom-up understanding of issues, definitions and frameworks.</p>\n<p>The engagement took the form of a half-day multi-stakeholder codesign (Sanders and Stappers 2008) workshop in Chicago, New York, and Boston that was attended by thirty designers, policymakers, business leaders, scholars, technologists, activists, and students in each city. The workshop was intended to introduce policymakers to human-centered design methods and more participatory ways of thinking through complex socio-technical issues. At the workshop, following icebreakers and a brief presentation, participants in groups of 5–6 people were encouraged to reflect on specific neighborhoods in the city that they had intimate knowledge of and select a context for their discussion of urban technology. Next, they were given a set of prompts about a specific values concept. For example, one team in the Chicago workshop was asked to contemplate the term “borderless.” The term is particularly relevant given the city’s physical and environmental boundaries (e.g. the river that separates the downtown business district known as “The Loop” from other parts of the city, as well as the urban transportation infrastructure that has segregated neighborhoods from one another). Once the team engaged in a discussion around the values concept, and reframed it from their own perspective, they were invited to begin prototyping ways of incorporating their own notions of the values concept into a specific design for the neighborhood that they had selected. The teams prototyped their ideas using design methods such as creating scenarios, layering maps, and building Lego models. Rather than prototyping solutions to specific problems, the exercise was more speculatively oriented towards designing alternative possibilities (Dunne and Raby 2013) for the future cities that they would like to inhabit in 30 years. Finally, the teams presented their ideas to one another in a design critique format, which emphasizes offering comments that improve existing ideas and generate new directions for the prototypes.</p>\n<p>Rather than focusing on solutions to urban problems, the Designing Policy workshops emphasized the introduction of more participatory and open processes such as codesign to the navigation of complex socio-technical public policy issues. In addition, by prototyping future scenarios, geographies and artifacts and raising questions about alternative possibilities for society, the project built on a critical design approach. In this way, the project combined a critical perspective from the social sciences with a more generative, hands-on approach from the field of design.</p>\n<p>However, despite the emphasis on participation, it is necessary to acknowledge that there are many social, economic and political barriers to engaging citizens. For example, many people do not have jobs that would allow them to participate in such a workshop during working hours, others may not be able to afford the transportation costs associated with attending and still others may not have the necessary educational background to feel that they could participate. As design researchers, our own social networks are necessarily limited and, thus, despite widespread outreach to potential participants, it is difficult to ensure a truly diverse group of participants, taking race, gender, economics, sexuality and other factors into consideration. In some cases, payment of an incentive may be necessary in order to attract participants that would not otherwise attend while, in other cases, partnering with an advocacy organization and focusing on a specific topic of high importance to a particular group might be helpful.</p>\n<p>Finally, even when a diverse group of participants can be engaged, it is important to note that collaboration and consensus is not necessary all of the time. In fact, it may be more important to find ways to surface the tensions, dissensus and disagreements, and formats that can allow these differing positions to contribute positively to reframing issues and opening up about the issues being discussed (Mouffe 2003). Again, the focus is not on solving problems but rather on learning processes that allow diverse groups to engage in raising questions. In this way, it is possible to imagine that new constituencies might form around complex socio-technical issues.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The Designing Policy project engaged approximately 100 participants in three cities in rethinking the role of urban technology in cities around citizen-defined values.</p>\n<p>Over 500 copies of the visual toolkit were printed and, to date, about half have been distributed. Notably, the City of Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics alone requested 20 copies. In addition, the visual toolkit has been viewed online over 750 times. One of the theoretical implications of the project is in the value of physical and visual artifacts in communicating complex ideas more quickly to a broader range of people than are typically reached by academic journal articles, which are not widely read, cited or circulated (Galey and Ruecker 2010, 414). This was illustrated through the hands-on prototyping activities that took place at the workshop as well as in the production of the visual toolkit.</p>\n<p>Codesign methods requires a different relationship between design researchers and their participants. Specifically, it requires that participants be treated and viewed not as research subjects, which implies hierarchy, but rather as peers, which necessitates a different set of concerns and approaches. As such, we deliberately decided not to survey or interview our participants as part of this project. While doing so might have resulted in a different understanding of the project’s impact, we, instead, have reflected on our own uncomfortable position in the research process. One of the methodological implications of the Designing Policy project is the acknowledgement of a need to create viable alternatives to university institutional review board (IRB) processes in order to accommodate participatory methodologies such as the replacement of a traditional consent-form with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that could be written by both parties.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Designing Policy project integrated approaches from codesign and critical design in order to probe discussion of values and ethics regarding urban technologies, which can be understood as a particular kind of civic media. These workshops, which can be understood as a kind of prototype or experiment, were the first step in developing a more focused approach to more participatory, collaborative and engaged modes of inquiry about alternative future possibilities for civic media in cities.

In recent years, cities have embraced the idea that they are platforms for the exchange of big data, laboratories for urban experiments, and spaces of civic hacking. These activities raise questions about the nature of civic engagement as well as the embedded values that inhabit civic media infrastructures in cities. While many of these activities have been focused on designing solutions to urban problems, others aim to raise new questions by mobilizing the lived experiences of citizens around specific matters of concern and alternative possible futures.\n\nThis case discusses the processes and tools created through a yearlong research project called “Designing Policy,” which included a series of workshops and a visual toolkit (can be downloaded [here](http://designingpolicytoolkit.org/)). The project wajs conducted in 2012–2013, in collaboration with Anijo Mathew at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology, and with funding from the Urban Communication Foundation. The workshops focused on a particular subset of civic media; namely, urban technologies, which are composed of the digital and material communication, and information infrastructures of cities (Foth et al. 2011). Urban environments are populated by an increasing number of technological residents such as LED screens that animate building facades, so-called ‘smart’ parking meters, and adaptive traffic signals as well as the millions of networked devices that people carry around on their bodies and bicycles as well as in their cars.\n\nThese new urban citizens with which we share our spaces and delegate our decisions are not well understood (Latour 1992). This is because the technologies (as well as the data that they collect) are often proprietary ‘black boxes,’ and the political decisions that result in their widespread appropriation and deployment take place within obscure government departments. The goal of the Designing Policy project was to open up the black box of urban technology as a site for the discussion of values (Nissenbaum 2001) and ethics, as well as to illustrate the ways in which urban technology systems might be designed around alternative framings and questions.\n\n&gt; &gt; The purpose of the design workshops and the visual toolkit was to interest participants from a broad range of backgrounds and expertise in thinking about urban technology as a site of intervention in public policy decisions and as a site where cities (and their politics) are made.\n\nSpecifically, given widespread interest in the use of big data and the ‘internet of things’ for the purpose of tracking and monitoring people as well as delivering city services, the workshops sought to increase awareness of the ways in which urban technologies mediate the relationships between citizens and policymakers around important issues; issues that are often defined in a top-down manner by policymakers such as privacy, security, efficiency, and innovation. At the same time, the workshops were intended to open up urban technologies as sites of experimentation and generative engagements that map onto the everyday lives of citizens — which include a deeper, messier, more nuanced and bottom-up understanding of issues, definitions and frameworks.\n\nThe engagement took the form of a half-day multi-stakeholder codesign (Sanders and Stappers 2008) workshop in Chicago, New York, and Boston that was attended by thirty designers, policymakers, business leaders, scholars, technologists, activists, and students in each city. The workshop was intended to introduce policymakers to human-centered design methods and more participatory ways of thinking through complex socio-technical issues. At the workshop, following icebreakers and a brief presentation, participants in groups of 5–6 people were encouraged to reflect on specific neighborhoods in the city that they had intimate knowledge of and select a context for their discussion of urban technology. Next, they were given a set of prompts about a specific values concept. For example, one team in the Chicago workshop was asked to contemplate the term “borderless.” The term is particularly relevant given the city’s physical and environmental boundaries (e.g. the river that separates the downtown business district known as “The Loop” from other parts of the city, as well as the urban transportation infrastructure that has segregated neighborhoods from one another). Once the team engaged in a discussion around the values concept, and reframed it from their own perspective, they were invited to begin prototyping ways of incorporating their own notions of the values concept into a specific design for the neighborhood that they had selected. The teams prototyped their ideas using design methods such as creating scenarios, layering maps, and building Lego models. Rather than prototyping solutions to specific problems, the exercise was more speculatively oriented towards designing alternative possibilities (Dunne and Raby 2013) for the future cities that they would like to inhabit in 30 years. Finally, the teams presented their ideas to one another in a design critique format, which emphasizes offering comments that improve existing ideas and generate new directions for the prototypes.\n\nRather than focusing on solutions to urban problems, the Designing Policy workshops emphasized the introduction of more participatory and open processes such as codesign to the navigation of complex socio-technical public policy issues. In addition, by prototyping future scenarios, geographies and artifacts and raising questions about alternative possibilities for society, the project built on a critical design approach. In this way, the project combined a critical perspective from the social sciences with a more generative, hands-on approach from the field of design.\n\nHowever, despite the emphasis on participation, it is necessary to acknowledge that there are many social, economic and political barriers to engaging citizens. For example, many people do not have jobs that would allow them to participate in such a workshop during working hours, others may not be able to afford the transportation costs associated with attending and still others may not have the necessary educational background to feel that they could participate. As design researchers, our own social networks are necessarily limited and, thus, despite widespread outreach to potential participants, it is difficult to ensure a truly diverse group of participants, taking race, gender, economics, sexuality and other factors into consideration. In some cases, payment of an incentive may be necessary in order to attract participants that would not otherwise attend while, in other cases, partnering with an advocacy organization and focusing on a specific topic of high importance to a particular group might be helpful.\n\nFinally, even when a diverse group of participants can be engaged, it is important to note that collaboration and consensus is not necessary all of the time. In fact, it may be more important to find ways to surface the tensions, dissensus and disagreements, and formats that can allow these differing positions to contribute positively to reframing issues and opening up about the issues being discussed (Mouffe 2003). Again, the focus is not on solving problems but rather on learning processes that allow diverse groups to engage in raising questions. In this way, it is possible to imagine that new constituencies might form around complex socio-technical issues.\n\n&gt; &gt; The Designing Policy project engaged approximately 100 participants in three cities in rethinking the role of urban technology in cities around citizen-defined values.\n\nOver 500 copies of the visual toolkit were printed and, to date, about half have been distributed. Notably, the City of Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics alone requested 20 copies. In addition, the visual toolkit has been viewed online over 750 times. One of the theoretical implications of the project is in the value of physical and visual artifacts in communicating complex ideas more quickly to a broader range of people than are typically reached by academic journal articles, which are not widely read, cited or circulated (Galey and Ruecker 2010, 414). This was illustrated through the hands-on prototyping activities that took place at the workshop as well as in the production of the visual toolkit.\n\nCodesign methods requires a different relationship between design researchers and their participants. Specifically, it requires that participants be treated and viewed not as research subjects, which implies hierarchy, but rather as peers, which necessitates a different set of concerns and approaches. As such, we deliberately decided not to survey or interview our participants as part of this project. While doing so might have resulted in a different understanding of the project’s impact, we, instead, have reflected on our own uncomfortable position in the research process. One of the methodological implications of the Designing Policy project is the acknowledgement of a need to create viable alternatives to university institutional review board (IRB) processes in order to accommodate participatory methodologies such as the replacement of a traditional consent-form with a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that could be written by both parties.\n\nIn sum, the Designing Policy project integrated approaches from codesign and critical design in order to probe discussion of values and ethics regarding urban technologies, which can be understood as a particular kind of civic media. These workshops, which can be understood as a kind of prototype or experiment, were the first step in developing a more focused approach to more participatory, collaborative and engaged modes of inquiry about alternative future possibilities for civic media in cities. There are two specific implications of the project at this stage. First, the Designing Policy project illustrated the ways in which physical and visual artifacts can be useful for communicating complex ideas about the nature of socio-technical systems. Second, the project highlighted the need to rethink traditional IRB processes in light of participatory design methodologies.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nFoth, Marcus, Laura Forlano, Christine Satchell, and Martin Gibbs, eds. 2011.

In the same period, Berlusconi was also accused of abusing his political power to free El Mahroug from a police station, where she had been detained for stealing 3,000 euros. In 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of sex with minors and abuse of power. This incident, which came to be known in the press as the “bunga bunga trial” (<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/11/what_the_heck_is_bunga_bunga.html\">Palmer 2010</a>), was but the latest scandal involving sex and women in the tainted history of Berlusconi’s mandates as prime minister. Berlusconi’s repeated derogatory and objectifying comments towards women have been reflective of a socio-political culture that digresses from women’s rights and fails to promote balanced representations of women’s roles in Italian society.</p>\n<p>This was the gendered status quo that Italian journalist Concita De Gregorio challenged in her petition in the left-wing newspaper <em>L’Unità (</em>L’Unità is an Italian left-wing newspaper, founded in 1924 by Antonio Gramsci as the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party) on January 19, 2011. In her short appeal (a mere seven sentences in all), De Gregorio <a href=\"http://www.unita.it/firmedonne/\">called for women to stand up to the <em>bunga bunga</em></a> culture that had permeated all levels of Italian society. This online petition was signed by almost 40,000 people and spurred the creation of the feminist movement <em>Se Non Ora Quando</em> (The name of the movement was inspired by Primo Levi’s 1982 homonymous novel about Jewish partisans and resistance fighters who struggled to survive and sabotage the German war machine during WWII- SNOQ; ‘if not now, when?’) in February 2011. Born from an increasing frustration and anger at the ‘demeaning model presented by one of the highest officials in the country,’ SNOQ was launched on February 13, 2011, through a series of concomitant demonstrations and public events in several major city squares that saw the participation of nearly one million people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_a8xrHVB3tcm_Oj8XL5tBkQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The founding committee of SNOQ consisted of fifty Italian women with different backgrounds and careers — ranging from journalists, writers and filmmakers, to economists, academicians, politicians, and architects — who came together to denounce the “repeated, indecent, flamboyant representation of women as a naked object of sexual trade, produced by newspapers, television, and advertising” (<a href=\"http://www.senonoraquando.eu/\">“Se non ora quando?” 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>Seventy three percent of the SNOQ members were between 40 and 70 years old, while only less than one fourth were women under 40 (“Mappatura Comitati Snoq” 2013). The movement was equally comprised of individuals who had previous experience in feminist activism, the ones new to these forms of civic engagement, as well as people affiliated to a specific political party (or labor union), and those who have never belonged to any such group. Indeed, one of the main characteristics of the SNOQ movement is precisely the heterogeneity of the group, something that was paradoxically criticized for lacking focus and specificity. (Melandri, 2011; Muraro, 2011; Pronzato, 2011) SNOQ developed as a national and local civic movement, which was originally promoted by a centralized organizing committee and subsequently, branched off into multiple local subcommittees. By the end of 2012, SNOQ counted more than 120 subcommittees in most Italian regions, speaking to the need to engage with the specificities of the localities — a key feature of civic activism in contemporary Italy (Ardizzoni, forthcoming). A transnational perspective was also added to the local angle with the creation of SNOQ committees in various cities in France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and Germany. In the early 2014, the heterogeneity and cross-sectional appeal of this feminist movement — considered as one of its main assets — proved also to be a central catalyst for its fragmentation into diversified interests and multiple sub-groups (SNOQLibere (SNOQFree) and SNOQFactory).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1__HX6k0xShyaJt01EUslXmA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_kcIGtm1B76A7WeuJGcxdng.png\" alt=\"Ardizzoni, Athens, Greece\"></p>\n<p>While the recent SNOQ movement is embedded in the long and rich history of Italian feminism(s), and thus embraced some key themes of previous waves (such as the centrality of the ‘network’ and the politicized female body), its use of new and social media tools is reflective of the nature of emergent activist practices (Dinelli 2011, 59–84). Indeed, as in the case of the Arab Spring or Occupy Wall Street, contemporary social movements have found in social media the appropriate tools to share anger and indignation, to mobilize disparate groups of individuals, to organize for empowerment, and to deliberate on creative alternatives (Castells 2012). With these objectives, the Italian SNOQ movement relied heavily on communication networks through their websites and blogs, their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, YouTube channel, social forums, and mailing lists.</p>\n<p>Of particular relevance in the context of participatory media is SNOQ’s use of online forums to organize a national meeting and its video campaign on YouTube. After the initial, fairly spontaneous demonstrations in February 2011, the SNOQ movement organized a two-day event in Siena in the summer 2011, which featured contributions by politicians, intellectuals, artists, and saw the participation of more than 2,000 people and 120 local committees. The organization of this national event, aimed at coordinating the future of this social movement, relied heavily on online forums, which were used by participants to share information on lodging, organize carpools and room sharing, and lay out the main strategies of intervention. Given the variety of individuals and groups who took part in the event, these online tools (forums and blogs) became the catalyst for a successful attendance. Similarly, the variety of feminist voices within the movement is unveiled in a series of short videos titled Le parole per dirlo (“Words to say it”), featuring women of all ages and backgrounds who speak on camera about their daily lives as women in Italy, relating their desires, their experiences of sexism and abuse, their precarious positions at work, and their hopes for female politicians. In the 142 videos, women are given a space to contrast the objectifying and flattening view of female bodies promoted by media and dominant discourse.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nlhaqMkisPkLLEp99MG-AA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; While this space is often stifled in mainstream Italian media, through participatory tools like YouTube, Italian feminists have re-created a public arena that allows them to revive the feminist tradition of orality and personal narration — a central element in previous waves of the movement.</p>\n<p>This case study highlights the convergence of social media use and street demonstrations as an effective tactic of participation and engagement in contemporary Italian society.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3mCXKqoU70\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/a3mCXKqoU70/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a>\n<em>Se non ora, quando? -LE PAROLE PER DIRLO, ILARIA / YouTube</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84EmczCsDfQ\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/84EmczCsDfQ/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a>\nSe non ora, quando? — LE PAROLE PER DIRLO, ISOKE / YouTube</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Ardizzoni, Michela.

A hackathon is an event in which a large number of people (typically computer programmers, but occasionally graphic designers, interface designers, and other stakeholders also join the mix) collaborate intensively on software projects (“Hackathon,” Wikipedia). But @SendGrid’s Falls seeks to distinguish the objectives and ethos of a hackathon from its rudimentary definition, answering the (albeit colloquially phrased) question, “Why is a hackathon a thing?” (Falls, “WHY Is a Hackathon?”).</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To learn &amp; teach.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To solve problems.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To create something new.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To meet like-minded people.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To build, because building is fun and rewarding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To gain the respect of peers, through creative expression.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To collaboratively push the limits of technology as we know it today.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not for all of these reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>To help companies sell their product and/or commission free labor.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To launch and/or fund new or existing businesses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To earn money and win prizes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>YCSC’s WebSlam modeled this approach, prioritizing community and learning above remuneration; as such, hackathons in general and this one in particular might be understood as propelled by intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, motivation (Deci and Ryan 2007). STEM Coordinator Nadia Despenza, organizer of YCSC’s WebSlam and the “go-to” person for all things STEM-related across YouthBuild’s California operations (Nationally, YouthBuild facilitates 273 programs in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, collectively engaging approximately 10,000 young adults per year. Thirteen of YCSC’s 18 schools are in southern California) might add two additional reasons to the list: To facilitate the entry of underrepresented individuals into STEM fields; To engage youth in a civic space.</p>\n<p><em>YCSC STEM Coordinator and WebSlam organizer Nadia Despenza | Photo: Laurel J. Felt</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"careers-and-community\">Careers and Community</h1>\n<p>Recent research suggests that efforts like Despenza’s are sorely needed (Felt, “Hacking for Gold: South L.A. Youths Code Towards a Better Future”). In terms of STEM participation (as measured by rates of taking STEM-related Advanced Placement exams (The College Board, Program Summary Report), earning bachelor’s degrees in computer science (Ashcraft, Eger, and Friend,Girls in IT: The Facts), and performing science and engineering jobs(National Science Foundation 2013)), and females and individuals of African-American and Latino descent are grossly underrepresented. This disparity has major economic implications, both for individuals and for the country.</p>\n<p>According to U.S. News and World Report’s 2014 coverage of the nation’s best jobs, web developers — that is, individuals who are “responsible for designing, coding and modifying websites, from layout to function and according to a client’s specifications” — earned a median salary in 2012 of $62,500 (“Best Technology Jobs: Web Developer”). Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects about 28,500 new web developer jobs will be created from 2012 to 2022; in fact, the next decade demands massively more highly skilled employees across the technology industry (“Best Technology Jobs: Web Developer”). The technology industry is growing, and there is space for our citizens — all of our citizens, including women and people of color — to serve it.</p>\n<p>Engaging youth in civic spaces can bring about a world of good. Youth have several gifts to offer a community, including time; ideas and creativity; connection to place; dreams and desires; peer group relationships; family relationships; credibility as teachers; and enthusiasm and energy (Kretzmann 1993). If youths’ assets are aligned with civic purposes, then meaningful growth for both individuals and neighborhoods can result. Civically engaged youth are more likely than uninvolved peers to avoid violence and delinquency, sense community membership, maintain cultural identity, enjoy emotional wellbeing, develop a strong work ethic, pursue education, and obtain employment (Zeldin 2004). Neighborhoods that foster youth service not only reap the benefits of these young people’s engagement but also can become asset-building communities, or communities that “provide a constant and equitable flow of asset-building energy to all children and adolescents” (Benson 2003).</p>\n<p>While we tend to think of civic spaces as geographical sites like city libraries or parks, the Project for Public Spaces describes civic spaces as “…settings where celebrations are held, where social and economic exchanges take place, where friends run into each other, and where cultures mix.” As such, digital destinations can function as civic spaces, and research has shown that indeed they do. Moreover, youth civic engagement scholars Joseph Kahne, Nam-jin Lee, and Jessica Feezell have found that nonpolitical online activity (which includes (but is not limited to) participating in a hackathon) “…can serve as a gateway to participation in civic and political life, including volunteering, community problem solving, protest activities, and political voice” (Kahne et al 2013). Therefore, as far as civic engagement is concerned, hackathon’s are a win-win-win.</p>\n<h1 id=\"educational-impacts\">Educational Impacts</h1>\n<p>Educationally, WebSlam participants benefited by learning through doing and developing important skills. Learning Through Doing:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Participants’ engagement with WebSlam showcased how hands-on, experiential learning, or “learning through doing,” is an effective mode of piquing interest, encouraging ownership, and scaffolding mastery.</p>\n<p>Participants learned to code via five after-school sessions prior to WebSlam. Although daily instruction concluded at 3 p.m., said instructor Oscar Menjivar, “We had students stay until 4 — that’s the time that we stayed. But I think if we were to stay maybe later, until 8 or 9, I think they would have wanted to stay.” His suspicions were confirmed on Saturday, when a team of three young men — Jose Sandoval, Hector Linares, and Michael Taton — refused to take a lunch break. While the trio might have been motivated by their work’s real world relevance (they were creating a site for a LATTC student’s start-up), it is likely that their passion for coding also kept them in their seats. Of coding, participant Taton, 21, a Spring 2014 graduate of CRCD Academy YouthBuild, said, “I just feel I pick it up easy” (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP2B0Yinrn8#t=41\">Taton 2014</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_g5-pDkfmemZTBk1LW5CYpA.png\" alt=\"(from left) Teammates Michael Taton, Hector Linares, and Michael Sandoval take a quick break from coding the website for Shaquann’s Gourmet Cookies in order to smile for the camera | Photo: J. Morr\"></p>\n<p>Menjivar’s “learning through doing” method encourages commitment and autonomy. Inevitably, said Menjivar, after learners gain familiarity with the tools, explore, self-express, believe that it’s okay to fail, and learn how to address setbacks, “they start to have fun. They don’t want to leave the classroom. They’re engaged, they want to talk to each other, they’re asking you questions like, ‘So Oscar, how do I get into more jobs like this?’ ‘So Oscar, where do I go next, where do I find more information?’”</p>\n<p>Despenza attested, “Certain participants have found their love for coding and are like, ‘We want to do this, we want to intern somewhere.’”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_0RkEm_r96s-cRjNMB8xJJA.png\" alt=\"Oscar Menjivar from URBAN TxT helps students with their website. | Photo: J. Morr\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"skill-development\">Skill Development</h1>\n<p>&gt; &gt; But coding doesn’t call to everyone; some participants indicated that they would rather not “geek out” on WordPress after WebSlam’s conclusion (Ito et al., Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out).</p>\n<p>They didn’t walk away empty-handed, however; investing in the hackathon provided them with opportunities to enrich several versatile skills. Explained Despenza, “Certain participants have learned, ‘I can do more than I thought I could.’ There was one student in particular — it was rough for him to get it down but he’s here today and he found, ‘I may not do this for the rest of my life, but I can do this if I put my mind to it.’” The significance of lessons such as this, and the value of positive self-talk such as Despenza modeled, is considerable (“Thought Self-Leadership,” Neck and Manz).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_xToa0i706hfuu-XXFYxOIw.png\" alt=\"Factual tech mentor Morgan Mullaney (R) assists student Yasmeen Summerlin (L) with her website for LATTC’s Cosmetology Department’s Salon Service. | Photo: J. Morr\"></p>\n<p>Yasmeen Summerlin, 20, an 11th grader at Home Sweet Home YouthBuild who plans to graduate this December, is one of those students who cultivated perseverance. Summerlin doesn’t plan to pursue web development; she wants to become a crime scene investigator, and aspires to enter Boston University’s prestigious forensic science program. “I was going to give up yesterday because my ideas were being shot down and I’m just trying to please people,” said Summerlin. “And when my ideas are being shot down to please people, I’m obviously not pleasing people, I’m not the person you should be working with. But she [her favorite teacher, Despenza] wanted me to stay for this, so then I said, ‘Okay. I don’t throw stuff out’” (Summerlin 2014). Summerlin’s team, which re-designed LATTC’s Cosmetology Department Salon Service, ultimately was awarded second-place.</p>\n<p>WebSlammers also practiced communication and collaboration. “[W]hen they first started,” Despenza recalled, “they didn’t know what they were doing, they were a little scared. And then they started to not just work as one but to collaboratively work as a group with autonomy. So they would assign people, like, ‘You’re a great coder, why don’t you do that,’ ‘You’re great at Photoshop, why don’t you do that.’” This is the quintessence of collective intelligence (McGonigal 2008), an important practice for developing and enriching communities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"community-impacts\">Community Impacts</h1>\n<p>YCSC’s WebSlam provided an opportunity for local entities to collaboratively serve the community and realize personally important goals, and for participating students to engage in service learning. Multi-party Collaboration:</p>\n<p>Teamwork epitomized the WebSlam experience all parties involved. Despenza contacted Menjivar, who agreed to provide the coding instruction for the WebSlam she envisioned. A mutual acquaintance introduced Despenza to Samantha Walters, Co-location America’s Vice-President of Online Strategy, who provided the necessary sponsorship dollars. Joseph Guerrieri, LATTC’s Dean of Academic Affairs and Workforce Development, volunteered to host WebSlam at the college’s computer lab. Melanie Vaget responded to Despenza’s and Walters’s call for mentors, rounding up a group of her colleagues from L.A.-based tech company Factual.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_G3eLMp2EEL8EYakFB_kcjA.png\" alt=\"Colocation America VP of Online Strategies Samantha Walters talks to student Jose Sandoval and client Robert Hubbard. | Photo: J. Morr\"></p>\n<p>YCSC’s WebSlam, therefore, identifies various types of community partners who might be incented to support a civic endeavor such as this. It also suggests “self-interest” as a screening criterion — that is, partners must recognize participation as a means by which to achieve an important goal (e.g., satisfying a core personal value, furthering the company’s mission, investing in future earning potentials).</p>\n<h1 id=\"service-learning\">Service Learning</h1>\n<p>Finally, YCSC’s WebSlam models service learning, defined as “a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities.” WebSlammers provided community service by furnishing four LATTC-associated entities with new websites: 1) LATTC student Hubbard’s local business, Shaquann’s<a href=\"http://samiewalt.com/\">Gourmet Cookies</a>; 2) LATTC’s Cosmetology Department’s <a href=\"http://salonservice.lattc.edu/\">salon</a>; 3) LATTC’s Transportation Technologies Department’s <a href=\"http://www.urbantxt.org/automotive/\">auto shop</a>; and 4) LATTC’s Associated Student Organization, the college’s <a href=\"http://aso.lattc.edu/\">student council</a> (Both the salon and the auto shop provide space for LATTC students to hone their respective crafts, earn income as they do so, and provide discounted services to neighbors).</p>\n<p>WebSlam participants also engaged in conversation and reflection throughout the day, guided by the imperatives to serve their clients and satisfy the event’s guidelines. Concluding their WebSlam experience, participants presented their websites to their clients before a panel of expert judges and interested community members. In various ways and to multiple constituencies, WebSlam participants’ learning mattered.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This civic media event provided an opportunity for female and minority youth to increase their awareness of STEM-related career paths, deepen civic engagement, learn about coding in a hands-on manner, and cultivate proficiency in several versatile skills. WebSlam partners were able to give back and realize personal goals, local entities received useful new websites, and the community supported service learning. Collectively, this benefits individual participants and facilitates neighborhood revival.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_7utzvUkL_J5whaa6A0Bdhw.png\" alt=\"All WebSlam participants, mentors, and event sponsors/organizers gather together with LA City Council Member Curren Price (center) | Photo: J.

Neighborhoods that foster youth service not only reap the benefits of these young people’s engagement but also can become asset-building communities, or communities that “provide a constant and equitable flow of asset-building energy to all children and adolescents” (Benson 2003).\n\nWhile we tend to think of civic spaces as geographical sites like city libraries or parks, the Project for Public Spaces describes civic spaces as “…settings where celebrations are held, where social and economic exchanges take place, where friends run into each other, and where cultures mix.” As such, digital destinations can function as civic spaces, and research has shown that indeed they do. Moreover, youth civic engagement scholars Joseph Kahne, Nam-jin Lee, and Jessica Feezell have found that nonpolitical online activity (which includes (but is not limited to) participating in a hackathon) “…can serve as a gateway to participation in civic and political life, including volunteering, community problem solving, protest activities, and political voice” (Kahne et al 2013). Therefore, as far as civic engagement is concerned, hackathon’s are a win-win-win.\n\n# Educational Impacts\n\nEducationally, WebSlam participants benefited by learning through doing and developing important skills. Learning Through Doing:\n\n&gt; &gt; Participants’ engagement with WebSlam showcased how hands-on, experiential learning, or “learning through doing,” is an effective mode of piquing interest, encouraging ownership, and scaffolding mastery.\n\nParticipants learned to code via five after-school sessions prior to WebSlam. Although daily instruction concluded at 3 p.m., said instructor Oscar Menjivar, “We had students stay until 4 — that’s the time that we stayed. But I think if we were to stay maybe later, until 8 or 9, I think they would have wanted to stay.” His suspicions were confirmed on Saturday, when a team of three young men — Jose Sandoval, Hector Linares, and Michael Taton — refused to take a lunch break. While the trio might have been motivated by their work’s real world relevance (they were creating a site for a LATTC student’s start-up), it is likely that their passion for coding also kept them in their seats. Of coding, participant Taton, 21, a Spring 2014 graduate of CRCD Academy YouthBuild, said, “I just feel I pick it up easy” ([Taton 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP2B0Yinrn8#t=41)).\n\n![(from left) Teammates Michael Taton, Hector Linares, and Michael Sandoval take a quick break from coding the website for Shaquann’s Gourmet Cookies in order to smile for the camera | Photo: J. Morr](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_g5-pDkfmemZTBk1LW5CYpA.png)\n\nMenjivar’s “learning through doing” method encourages commitment and autonomy. Inevitably, said Menjivar, after learners gain familiarity with the tools, explore, self-express, believe that it’s okay to fail, and learn how to address setbacks, “they start to have fun. They don’t want to leave the classroom. They’re engaged, they want to talk to each other, they’re asking you questions like, ‘So Oscar, how do I get into more jobs like this?’ ‘So Oscar, where do I go next, where do I find more information?’”\n\nDespenza attested, “Certain participants have found their love for coding and are like, ‘We want to do this, we want to intern somewhere.’”\n\n![Oscar Menjivar from URBAN TxT helps students with their website. | Photo: J. Morr](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_0RkEm_r96s-cRjNMB8xJJA.png)\n\n# Skill Development\n\n&gt; &gt; But coding doesn’t call to everyone; some participants indicated that they would rather not “geek out” on WordPress after WebSlam’s conclusion (Ito et al., Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out).\n\nThey didn’t walk away empty-handed, however; investing in the hackathon provided them with opportunities to enrich several versatile skills. Explained Despenza, “Certain participants have learned, ‘I can do more than I thought I could.’ There was one student in particular — it was rough for him to get it down but he’s here today and he found, ‘I may not do this for the rest of my life, but I can do this if I put my mind to it.’” The significance of lessons such as this, and the value of positive self-talk such as Despenza modeled, is considerable (“Thought Self-Leadership,” Neck and Manz).\n\n![Factual tech mentor Morgan Mullaney (R) assists student Yasmeen Summerlin (L) with her website for LATTC’s Cosmetology Department’s Salon Service. | Photo: J. Morr](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_xToa0i706hfuu-XXFYxOIw.png)\n\nYasmeen Summerlin, 20, an 11th grader at Home Sweet Home YouthBuild who plans to graduate this December, is one of those students who cultivated perseverance. Summerlin doesn’t plan to pursue web development; she wants to become a crime scene investigator, and aspires to enter Boston University’s prestigious forensic science program. “I was going to give up yesterday because my ideas were being shot down and I’m just trying to please people,” said Summerlin. “And when my ideas are being shot down to please people, I’m obviously not pleasing people, I’m not the person you should be working with. But she [her favorite teacher, Despenza] wanted me to stay for this, so then I said, ‘Okay. I don’t throw stuff out’” (Summerlin 2014). Summerlin’s team, which re-designed LATTC’s Cosmetology Department Salon Service, ultimately was awarded second-place.\n\nWebSlammers also practiced communication and collaboration. “[W]hen they first started,” Despenza recalled, “they didn’t know what they were doing, they were a little scared. And then they started to not just work as one but to collaboratively work as a group with autonomy. So they would assign people, like, ‘You’re a great coder, why don’t you do that,’ ‘You’re great at Photoshop, why don’t you do that.’” This is the quintessence of collective intelligence (McGonigal 2008), an important practice for developing and enriching communities.\n\n# Community Impacts\n\nYCSC’s WebSlam provided an opportunity for local entities to collaboratively serve the community and realize personally important goals, and for participating students to engage in service learning. Multi-party Collaboration:\n\nTeamwork epitomized the WebSlam experience all parties involved. Despenza contacted Menjivar, who agreed to provide the coding instruction for the WebSlam she envisioned. A mutual acquaintance introduced Despenza to Samantha Walters, Co-location America’s Vice-President of Online Strategy, who provided the necessary sponsorship dollars. Joseph Guerrieri, LATTC’s Dean of Academic Affairs and Workforce Development, volunteered to host WebSlam at the college’s computer lab. Melanie Vaget responded to Despenza’s and Walters’s call for mentors, rounding up a group of her colleagues from L.A.-based tech company Factual.\n\n![Colocation America VP of Online Strategies Samantha Walters talks to student Jose Sandoval and client Robert Hubbard. | Photo: J. Morr](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_G3eLMp2EEL8EYakFB_kcjA.png)\n\nYCSC’s WebSlam, therefore, identifies various types of community partners who might be incented to support a civic endeavor such as this. It also suggests “self-interest” as a screening criterion — that is, partners must recognize participation as a means by which to achieve an important goal (e.g., satisfying a core personal value, furthering the company’s mission, investing in future earning potentials).\n\n# Service Learning\n\nFinally, YCSC’s WebSlam models service learning, defined as “a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities.” WebSlammers provided community service by furnishing four LATTC-associated entities with new websites: 1) LATTC student Hubbard’s local business, Shaquann’s[Gourmet Cookies](http://samiewalt.com/); 2) LATTC’s Cosmetology Department’s [salon](http://salonservice.lattc.edu/); 3) LATTC’s Transportation Technologies Department’s [auto shop](http://www.urbantxt.org/automotive/); and 4) LATTC’s Associated Student Organization, the college’s [student council](http://aso.lattc.edu/) (Both the salon and the auto shop provide space for LATTC students to hone their respective crafts, earn income as they do so, and provide discounted services to neighbors).\n\nWebSlam participants also engaged in conversation and reflection throughout the day, guided by the imperatives to serve their clients and satisfy the event’s guidelines. Concluding their WebSlam experience, participants presented their websites to their clients before a panel of expert judges and interested community members. In various ways and to multiple constituencies, WebSlam participants’ learning mattered.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis civic media event provided an opportunity for female and minority youth to increase their awareness of STEM-related career paths, deepen civic engagement, learn about coding in a hands-on manner, and cultivate proficiency in several versatile skills. WebSlam partners were able to give back and realize personal goals, local entities received useful new websites, and the community supported service learning. Collectively, this benefits individual participants and facilitates neighborhood revival.\n\n![All WebSlam participants, mentors, and event sponsors/organizers gather together with LA City Council Member Curren Price (center) | Photo: J.

It shows that hackers practice a wide range of insider and outsider tactics related to media technologies and infrastructures (MTI). The rationale is to examine hackers as actors that practice politics through, with and about MTI and by doing so to deepen the understanding of contemporary civic engagements.

Ever since its establishment the Club does not only practice so-called hacktivism (Jordan and Taylor 1998), but in fact engages in a plurality of political activities by acting through, with and about MTI (Kubitschko, 2015).

It is important to note that “alternative” in this context should not be treated synonymously with “autonomy.” As Chris Kelty puts it, “independence from power is not absolute; it is provisional and structured in response to the historically constituted layering of power and control within the infrastructures of computing and communication” (Kelty 2008, 9).</p>\n<p>Third, CCC members are acting about MTI by articulating their knowledge, skills and experiences.

Given the growing relevance of media environments for political constellations mainstream media continue to be exceptionally significant for actors to publicly voice their concerns (Couldry 2012). Over recent years both the amount of media coverage as well as the frequency of access by CCC members to mainstream media has increased drastically.

While most of the time we hear about the positives of this type of program, less is heard about the negatives or the problems faced by schools unless it is on the grand scale such as the Los Angeles School Department (Blume 2014). The overarching issue is that schools still tend to jump on technology bandwagons without thinking through the process of applying a new tool, considering the impact on curriculum, or even providing viable teacher professional development opportunities that demonstrate best practices. The introduction of the iPad has proved to be no different. Additionally, there was even less understanding of how to engage the audience that they are using the iPads with — the students.</p>\n<p>Working with the implementation of an iPad program in middle school for the last two years has proven to be a lesson in civic discourse and disengagement. The idea of using iPads was welcomed almost immediately, especially with the consideration that the program would be balancing the needs of all the students who were using the iPads with equitable access both in and out of school. As part of the program, students would be able to connect digitally and it would be paid for through a donor program. Having this secondary piece was enticing to implementation because it meant that a bridge was conceived between what was happening in the school and what was available at home.</p>\n<p>Teachers were minimally trained with what apps would function best for them within their curricular areas before September rolled around, and students in the 8th grade were provided with the tool. The roll out of the program in the first year involved approximately 100 students. The decision was made that there would be few restrictions on the iPad itself. After all, as citizens of the digital world, the expectation was that they would be able to handle the tool and use it according to the prescribed rules that were set and signed off by both parent and student.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Middle schoolers are a breed of their own and while it was presumed that all students would use the tool appropriately, the fact remained that many did not.</p>\n<p>Moreover, engagement in the iPad was being used for academic purposes, but for students the iPad was a source of entertainment whereby students could connect with their friends through their social networks, where they could download and play games, and where they could also watch YouTube videos and other sources of videos for fun. The distraction of the toy became problematic with students using the Photo Booth function to create funny faces, and pictures and videos taken for the purpose of capturing friends and sometimes the opposite — making enemies.</p>\n<p>As a tool for learning, it became obvious that students were rebelling against the idea. At one point, a student turned to the technology coordinator and said she wanted to “turn in the iPad.” The tech coordinator was taken aback, when he asked why, she said it wasn’t helping her to do her work, but was actually hindering her ability to learn. As part of the program, students were to use the iPad applications designated to them by curriculum areas for their assignments. This proved to be a struggle for many students especially because many of the tools used were for traditional purposes of typing work. In providing the iPad, there was no consideration for the differentiating of learners or that while the iPad is a “touch” screen source, many students required a keyboard in order to fully do their work. They needed their iPads to become tablets. Besides these academic issues, the school had not upgraded their network. Wifi points in the school were not sufficient for the influx of 150 iPads along with the already existing 300 devices that were hitting the wifi system. Moreover, some classrooms could not even connect to the wifi port because of structural issues thus making the use of the iPad a moot point in those particular classrooms.</p>\n<p>Teachers who were instructing with the tool were finding it discouraging. They also believed that the students were learning less because they were encountering so many technological problems. At the end of the first year of implementation teachers convened and discussed modifications on the iPad as well as limited access points for students. At the same time, the technology coordinator of the program noted that the Wifi points in the school would be updated and modifications made. Special needs teachers discussed providing additional accessories for the iPad that would benefit their learners.</p>\n<p>Year two of the program did not prove to be easier. In fact, the dissatisfaction with the tool came to the forefront when the teachers realized the Wifi system had not been updated and many of their concerns from the previous year were not acknowledged. The one thing that did go into action was a systematic lock-down of the iPad. Students could no longer download any apps. The apps were pre-selected by the teachers and those were the only ones serviceable to the students. YouTube and Photo Booth were both removed from the docket.</p>\n<p>These technology issues and freedom of access issues came up in the end-of-year discussions with students at the close of year two.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Students were asked to relay their experiences and to tell what they liked about using the iPad and what they did not like about using the iPad.</p>\n<p>Their responses were indicative of who they are generationally, but also how they felt about the limited access and their inability to contribute their ideas to the use of the iPad thereby demonstrating the lack of their participatory engagement and discourse. Yet, there were still positive comments for why they liked the iPad:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“I didn’t have to lug around a thousand notebooks and folders.”</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“That you didn’t have to worry about losing papers or anything because everything was stored into your iPad on notability and other apps.”</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“In a way it made doing some work easier. I would be able to fix certain items even if it is already typed on notability and the touch screen was easy to maneuver since I am use to using “I” technology. Also that it was fast and almost handy when I needed it most.”</em></p>\n<p>These comments were the most detailed and encouraging, but many students noted that there was ‘nothing’ that they liked most about using the iPad in school. The reasons for why they did not like the iPad:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“Sometimes the apps would act very annoying, like closing out, freezing, or the internet not working even when I was in school.”</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“There were a lot of problems with it functioning. The first time we updated all my work and most of my apps were deleted including Notability. I think it is much quicker to write on paper. I also think it gives kids an automatic homework excuse if they, say it wasn’t working. It’s hard to complete homework on it. The online textbooks would better be used on a computer because they don’t function with the IPad well. Many kids also never have them charged which gives them another excuse and also sets them back due to being ill prepared. And a notebook can never “die”. It is also quicker to access things and get prepared for class by just pulling out a notebook.”</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“I really didn’t like the technical difficulties we had to deal with when we were using it, especially during testing. There were also some difficulties handing in assignments, downloading and upgrading apps, and using apps.”</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“I didn’t like how we didn’t get to download our own apps. I also didn’t like how there were no games on the iPads. Also the iPads were very slow and there were many glitches. I also didn’t like testing on the iPads.”</em></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the most common comment from students was, “We have no freedom.” This also led to student discussion on what they would want to have happen for future students using the tool. Comments ranged from “more trust,” to “a bit more freedom to be able to download apps that we want” to “less restrictions.” One student even went on to mention that they would have appreciated it if the teachers were using the iPads as much as they were requiring the students to do so.</p>\n<p>As for the teachers, their frustration can be found in the lack of communication from administrators to teaching staff. Further, there has been no teacher professional development in the use of iPads with the different curricular areas, nor have we seen how it would be infused with the Common Core Standards. Much of the learning and teaching has been done at the grassroots level with teachers aiding each other and passing along the information. The other conversation that has not occurred centers around the idea of ‘control.’ Who determines what gets used and when? Which teachers? Does this impede curricular work if one teacher wants an app that could be a distraction in another subject area for a different teacher? The solutions to these problems are not simple and ones that have not been completely addressed to the satisfaction of all who are involved in the iPad program.</p>\n<p>Students concerns and ideas have not been addressed as of yet. The third year of the iPad program will commence this September and no communication has ensued or professional development — the two most important items to educators as previously noted. In the meantime, the past two years have shown that introducing a new technology into the school curriculum does not necessarily make it a viable academic option for all students. It also provides insight as to where the school community needs to engage further in discussions that are inclusive of all participants who will be affected by a new technological program — including the most active users — the students.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Blume, Howard. 2014. “LAUSD Shifts Gears on Technology for Students,” <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, June 29, accessed June 29, 2014,<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-laptops-20140630-story.html\">http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-laptops-20140630-story.html</a>.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

There were also some difficulties handing in assignments, downloading and upgrading apps, and using apps.”_\n\n&gt; &gt; _“I didn’t like how we didn’t get to download our own apps. I also didn’t like how there were no games on the iPads. Also the iPads were very slow and there were many glitches. I also didn’t like testing on the iPads.”_\n\nUltimately, the most common comment from students was, “We have no freedom.” This also led to student discussion on what they would want to have happen for future students using the tool. Comments ranged from “more trust,” to “a bit more freedom to be able to download apps that we want” to “less restrictions.” One student even went on to mention that they would have appreciated it if the teachers were using the iPads as much as they were requiring the students to do so.\n\nAs for the teachers, their frustration can be found in the lack of communication from administrators to teaching staff. Further, there has been no teacher professional development in the use of iPads with the different curricular areas, nor have we seen how it would be infused with the Common Core Standards. Much of the learning and teaching has been done at the grassroots level with teachers aiding each other and passing along the information. The other conversation that has not occurred centers around the idea of ‘control.’ Who determines what gets used and when? Which teachers? Does this impede curricular work if one teacher wants an app that could be a distraction in another subject area for a different teacher? The solutions to these problems are not simple and ones that have not been completely addressed to the satisfaction of all who are involved in the iPad program.\n\nStudents concerns and ideas have not been addressed as of yet. The third year of the iPad program will commence this September and no communication has ensued or professional development — the two most important items to educators as previously noted. In the meantime, the past two years have shown that introducing a new technology into the school curriculum does not necessarily make it a viable academic option for all students. It also provides insight as to where the school community needs to engage further in discussions that are inclusive of all participants who will be affected by a new technological program — including the most active users — the students.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nBlume, Howard. 2014. “LAUSD Shifts Gears on Technology for Students,” _The Los Angeles Times_, June 29, accessed June 29, 2014,[http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-laptops-20140630-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-laptops-20140630-story.html).\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

The overall idea behind the project was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To analyze what city inhabitants and visitors publish on different social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Flickr);</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To extract indicators on how these people perceive and live in the urban environment;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To use this knowledge to feed more inclusive urban design processes (e.g., by measuring the real-time reactions of citizens towards new architectural interventions).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Urban Sensing built upon several existing projects, either conducted by research institutions (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa\">CASA at the University College London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/\">Spatial Information Design Lab at the Columbia University</a> or Senseable City Lab at the <a href=\"http://senseable.mit.edu\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>) or independent designers and design firms (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.softhook.com/\">Christian Nold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artisopensource.net/\">Art is Open Source</a> or Stamen Design7). The trajectory of Urban Sensing was also influenced by the work of scholars coming from different disciplines, from geography, to urban studies, up to computer science (Zook and Graham 2007; Girardin et al. 2008; Kotov, Zhai, and Sproat 2011; Liu et al. 2011; Shi and Barker 2011). In a 24-month period, the team (T-Connect and Accurat from Italy, IT4All from France, the Technical University of Kosice from Slovakia, Mobivery from Spain and LUST from the Netherlands) behind Urban Sensing created and tested a technological platform, which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Gathers data from 4 social media streams: Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare and Flickr;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Applies multiple strategies (including text mining) to analyze these data and extract indicators related to several areas of interest (such as characterizations and perceived identities of geographic areas or users’ feeling toward local policies and urban interventions);</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Visualizes the results, plotting them on a web-based map, like in the Figure 1, which represents the position of geo-located tweets in the city of Milan (Italy) in a two-week period (January 2012). Colors denote the eight most adopted languages while writing the tweets (yellow = Italian, green = English, bright green = Indonesian; pink = Spanish, light pink = French; blue = Dutch; light blue = Portuguese; and red = Japanese).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_yUIV3TkrhDOBcMRVKPdcvA.png\" alt=\"Figure 1 Screenshot produced during Urban Sensing and showing geo-located tweets in the city of Milan in January 2012 (Lupi et al. 2012)\"></p>\n<p>Urban Sensing and its visualizations can be used by city designers, planners and administrators or accessed by a broader audience interested in urban dynamics. Imagine, for example, that some urban planners were working on a new master plan for the area of Bovisa, a district in Milan where the quite large Polytechnic University is located; they could use the Urban Sensing platform and identify the most crowded areas of this district by tracking the number of photos and contributions originated from or related to specific geographic locations (Flickr, Twitter, Facebook) or the number of check-ins in Foursquare for each venue in a predefined time-lapse. In Figure 2, Urban Sensing platform plots the geographic locations associated to Twitter contributions (blue dots) on a geographic map of Milan, also displaying the time trends (i.e., the number of contributions per day in the time span).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_sB9sRnVGOcLJyCagko8XSw.png\" alt=\"Figure 2 Urban Sensing, visual representation of the area of Bovisa, in Milan (August-September 2013)\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2 shows how, during weekdays, the Bovisa university campus presents spikes of social media activity during lesson hours (9 a.m. to 6 p.m.), whilst the nearby UCI movie theatre and the shopping center are the stage for a high concentration of social media activity from 9 p.m. until midnight. This data can be further analyzed by tracking contributions from single users and — consequently — investigating how the users move across the city. In Figure 3, the blue dots represent the initial position of the users, whilst the green and red dots show the positions of the same users immediately before and after. By connecting the dots, we can clearly trace users’ movements over time and have an idea not only of the most crowded areas of Bovisa, but also of the locations where specific students come from before getting to the Polytechnic campus, and where they go after. In this sense, the analyses elaborated with Urban Sensing highlight some of the students’ patterns of use for this specific area of Milan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_OwdXoKDI6OTQtSBP2uwmbA.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 Urban Sensing: Map of the Bovisa area, Milan (August-September 2013)\"></p>\n<p>Urban Sensing aimed at investigating the potential of this and other more complex types of social media analyses and visualizations to support participatory urban design processes. The basic tenet was that through this kind of technological platforms some of the needs and desires of the city inhabitants and visitors could emerge and be heard by urban administrators, designers and planners. In the specific example above mentioned, the findings helped both Milan city administrators and real estate companies in identifying suitable areas to build student housing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-limitations-of-urban-sensing-and-the-problem-of-missing-intentionality\">The limitations of Urban Sensing and the problem of missing intentionality</h1>\n<p>Urban Sensing was a research project also oriented to investigating the limitations of this kind of approaches, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Not all city inhabitants and visitors have equal access to technologies and skills to post geo-located contributions (According to Gartner (June 2014), smartphones account for 66% of all mobile phone global sales in 2014)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Although Urban Sensing fully respected the guidelines offered by each social media platform in terms of privacy policy and in some cases also applied anonymization techniques (Naor and Yung 1989), there are still serious issues in terms of privacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The accuracy of geo-located social media analyses is affected by the distribution of free WIFI networks.

In these cases, they might still travel with their smartphone and use it, for example, to take pictures or notes to be shared at a later stage when they have access to a WIFI network (typically, either a free or public one or the one at their hotel). Obviously, the distribution of these WIFI networks in the city affects the geographic dimension of social media analyses, as a large number of contributions might emerge in areas where accessible WIFI networks are located.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elsewhere, these limitations of Urban Sensing have been more thoroughly described (Ciuccarelli, Lupi, and Simeone 2014).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The focus here is the problem of the lack of intentionality.</p>\n<p>Urban Sensing does not only collect users’ contributions related to the context of their use and perception of the city but also all kinds of contributions such as private comments or conversations with friends that are completely unrelated to urban issues.

Can this lack of intentionality undermine the potential of this kind of platforms as tools for more participatory processes?</p>\n<p>Participatory design has been defined as a “process of investigating, understanding, reflecting upon, establishing, developing, and supporting mutual learning between multiple participants” who strongly contribute to the design activities (Simonsen and Robertson 2013, 2). In the specific context of Urban Sensing, this definition highlights the need for the users to become part of the design process (as participants) through a specific act of will.

As Ratti and Townsend argued: ‘‘Rather than focusing on the installation and control of network hardware, city governments, technology companies and their urban-planning advisers can exploit a more ground-up approach to creating even smarter cities in which people become the agents of change’’ (Ratti and Townsend 2011, 44).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Platforms and approaches such as Urban Sensing can easily become instruments of control and surveillance if the users are not actively involved as participants.</p>\n<p>In order to tackle this risk, the users first need to be aware of these platforms and of how they can control their interaction with them (Galloway 2004). Secondly, it is important to set mechanisms of participation that guarantee that all city stakeholders have sustained access to these platforms as tools of expression, investigation and critique. It is only when the city stakeholders (a) are aware of the potential and the limitations of platforms such as Urban Sensing, (b) are in the conditions of actively participating and (c) their agency is framed by a clear intentionality, that they become agents of change and not passive recipients of top-down approaches.</p>\n<h1 id=\"final-remarks\">Final remarks</h1>\n<p>In a way, Urban Sensing showed how social media analyses could support urban design, decision-making and administration, but at present there are still serious shortcomings for these approaches to be used as a tool of collaborative intervention.

The program’s design therefore draws upon concepts of political and civic education in that we recognize the need for relevant and deep knowledge about the roots of social problems, and encourage the students to think about “what is” and “what ought to be (see, e.g., Gordon, 2013; Levin, 2011).”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_TFOjOs-Wi02MBjkVq8SUqw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In our desire to foreground using media to create change, we’ve also had to address the “audience problem” of youth media in creative ways, because as Peter Levine (2008) has pointed out, youth media programs tend to focus on the production of student voice rather than on its reception (see also Soep, 2006, 2011). . This case study discusses how we helped students to experience empowerment as they thought not only about the audience for their particular media product, but also about how their media efforts fit with the larger efforts of a local grassroots organization; an organization that had long been working for better educational outcomes in economically challenged communities like theirs. By playing a role in that organization’s expansive reach, the students were contributing to expanding the audience for the organization’s efforts; thereby channeling their energies toward broader efforts that were already making a difference in the bigger community. In this way, this case study is an example of an alliance-oriented digital media literacy project — an exploration of what happens when digital media literacy is positioned at the core of civic education in an effort to push further the agenda that’s become known as “participatory politics,” or the effort to link student interests and digital media enthusiasm with political initiatives (Mihailidis, 2009; Mihaidilis &amp; Thevenin, 2013). This experience has convinced me that partnering such programs with longstanding community activist groups is a way in which students can experience a more sustained approach to political engagement, and it’s therefore a model I’d like to see tested and developed further.</p>\n<p>Our school/community partnership began when two of the students in Digital Media Club, Ezana and Karim, introduced the group to the work of Padres Y Jovenes Unidos (Parents &amp; Youth United, or PJU), a group that started in Denver and that was engaged in a campaign that PJU called “End the School to Jail Track.” Their target was zero tolerance approaches to discipline that disproportionately affect students of color in schools across the United States. As part of the campaign, PJU produced a report demonstrating that police involvement in high school discipline had resulted in an increase in school suspensions; showed that there was a link between increased suspensions and higher high school dropout rates, which in turn related to higher rates of incarceration. PJU wanted to turn this around by limiting police presence in schools and by offering support for more effective in-school disciplinary policies so that vulnerable populations would stay in school and out of jail. With funding to implement pilot projects they developed alternatives to the “zero tolerance” approach. They established several restorative justice programs in urban high schools that encouraged students to assume responsibility for repairing the damages that they caused. PJU regularly held rallies to increase support for their efforts statewide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_roWak62A_f0xf3WqSeo_nw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When Ezana learned that students in another high school had developed a skit to illustrate the differences between punitive and restorative approaches to discipline, he and his peers sought to create a similar skit for their own school, working with Digital Media Club to help film it. The student leaders cast fellow students in the roles of fighting students, stern security officers, a traditional principal who embraces first a punitive and then a restorative justice approach, and a restorative justice counselor who works with the students to discuss what each can do to address and be accountable for the consequences of their actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Ur2CCuHSfIEhKfulY2cXhg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The students took great joy in writing and filming the skit. While filming the fight scene, lots of laughter ensued as the school’s security guards actually showed up to see what all the noise was about. And once the filming and editing were complete, the students circulated the video wide across their social media networks. They also shared it with teachers and with the school’s principal, who — much to the students’ delight — used it in a teacher/training event to demonstrate the value of embracing a restorative justice approach in their school. This was only possible because their work was linked to the wider efforts of PJU that had already gained a place on the school’s agenda.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_hO6lLrUKHZeUuLP3hPOcuQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>While the students were planning and filming the skit, the larger PJU organization continued to work with the Denver Public Schools to craft a new discipline policy that limited the police presence in schools and that outlined protections for students and their families. They also worked with the state senate to craft what came to be known as the “smart discipline” bill that aimed to expand the policy into a statewide law. As the bill moved through the state senate, the students involved in the Digital Media Club followed the news and kept their friends updated. When the state senate passed the bill at the end of the school year, the students were overjoyed. They knew that they had expanded PJU’s work in their own school, and so they experienced themselves as participants in the larger political action and felt a great deal of ownership in the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>A year after many of the students involved had graduated from high school and two years after creating and circulating among their networks their skit about restorative justice, President Obama suggested making “smart discipline” a national priority. And those students who had worked on using media to envision “what ought to be” could feel pride in knowing that their efforts had joined with many others to bring about political change that would affect their communities for years to come.</p>\n<p>This case shares important similarities with a number of “participatory politics” efforts taking place in relation to digital media literacy programs in that it involves following young people as they define the political issues of concern to them and as they decide upon the strategies they would like to embrace (Banaji &amp; Buckingham, 2013; Bennett, 2008; Dahlgen, 2012; Flanagan, 2013; Soep, 2014). What was particularly unique about this instance was that it situates individual political agency in the context of larger and more long-term efforts to bring about positive social change; and it focuses on changes that are deemed important within the context of many disenfranchised communities, drawing upon frameworks from social movement and political mobilization theories (Gordon, 2009; Lipsitz, 2005).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The students’ work in creating a story of “what ought to be” and circulating it among their communities helped them see themselves as communicators who were part of an effort to address injustices in their community — an effort that had begun before them, and that would continue long after after their own direct involvement ends.</p>\n<p>Through their ability to connect media literacy with civic engagement activities, they came to see the value in organizations like Padres Y Jovenes Unidos that serve a watchdog function in connecting community concerns with political initiatives. And their work both in their local situation and in relation to a much broader information campaign therefore enabled them to draw a connection between their own stories and concerns and those of their communities. Through their involvement in a critical digital media literacy effort, they came to see themselves as engaged in a much broader effort of political reform toward “what ought to be” in our public schools.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Banaji, S. and Buckingham, D.

The club brings university students and high school students together on a weekly basis in an effort to support the high school students as they seek to “use media to make a difference in their communities.”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_64yuvJyPF1mnrBRWYSHt8Q.png)\n\nThe club’s focus is rooted in ideas of critical digital media literacy as students both critically evaluate and create media (see, e..g., Hobbs, 2010; Kellner &amp; Share, 2005; Livingstone, 2004; Thevenin, 2012; Turner, 2011).

Because teens with CF are quarantined from each other, RtoT creates socio-emotional connections through video storytelling. Patients use iPads to produce and edit digital videos, which tell stories about moments in their life that exemplify their personal, embodied experiences with CF. This pedagogic focus emerged from a year of ethnographic study in which multiple CF patients expressed their desires both to learn digital video production and to share knowledge around teen life with CF that adult-driven websites avoid or simply eschew. Thus, this case questions how researchers and teachers might continue to design opportunities that support personally and emotionally resonant civic learning experiences with new media for adolescents in the hospital and beyond.</p>\n<h1 id=\"methods-for-emotionally-resonant-pedagogy-and-study-implementation\">Methods for Emotionally Resonant Pedagogy and Study Implementation</h1>\n<p>Interested in civic media learning as a social, affective experience, RtoT pushes the boundaries of social design experiments in which educational programs are considered “open systems that are subject to revision, disruptions, and contradictions and are co-designed”(Gutiérrez and Vossoughi 2009, 102). With the goal of expanding social design methods to attend more closely to affect, program implementation focused on intersections between researchers’ emerging feelings and participants’ desires to tell stories about their experiences. For example, researchers reflected on their able-bodied nervousness about adolescents’ desires to share feelings about mortality, felt those stories’ potential to inspire self-care, and followed the stories to their publication on YouTube, choosing not to allow their tentativeness to dampen patients’ desires to tell. Thus, moments of affective intensities were focal points in analysis and program development (Hollett and Christian Ehret 2014): research and pedagogy worked side by side to develop and understand adolescent’s desires for civic media production.</p>\n<h1 id=\"austin-a-case-of-affectively-engaged-civic-media-production\">Austin: A Case of Affectively Engaged Civic Media Production</h1>\n<p>At sixteen, Austin has undergone routine hospitalizations for most of his life. A genetic disease, CF affects Austin’s respiratory system and his ability to absorb nutrients from food. As a result, he undergoes respiratory treatment in the hospital for two-week periods at least twice a year. Early in the project, Austin expressed the desire to develop a “better” website for learning about CF while he showed researchers popular websites he considered “uninformative.” These sites were adult-driven with little more than the information about which he was already expert, having been treated by adults for his CF all of his life. Moreover, the sites, developed by adults for an adolescent audience, sounded like adult entreaties aimed at kids telling them to “take care of themselves.”</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Austin showed researchers YouTube videos teens had uploaded in which they described what it was like to live with CF (Figure 1). Not having much, or any, physical contact with other teens living with the same condition, Austin found this teen-perspective especially impactful. One YouTuber, hollyrosanna, moved him especially. He compared how her skin color, which evinced a bluishness connected to oxygen depletion, revealed the progression of her CF in a way that he thought adult-driven websites elided. On those sites, he said, teens living with CF were not visibly ill. Austin continued playing videos in which hollyrosanna described in detail how she managed CF, her social life, and her first year at university. He ruminated on her appearance, connected to his own, and pondered what it might be like to go to college and manage life on his own.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_2M8bd-x5zhSAcZT4EnuPRQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A few days after exploring these videos together, the RtoT team collaborated with him to make a YouTube video. They started a private YouTube channel on which they imagined other patients could share experiences important to them, or, as Austin put it, experiences that “only other CFers would understand” (Figure 2).

Because teens with CF are quarantined from each other, RtoT creates socio-emotional connections through video storytelling. Patients use iPads to produce and edit digital videos, which tell stories about moments in their life that exemplify their personal, embodied experiences with CF. This pedagogic focus emerged from a year of ethnographic study in which multiple CF patients expressed their desires both to learn digital video production and to share knowledge around teen life with CF that adult-driven websites avoid or simply eschew. Thus, this case questions how researchers and teachers might continue to design opportunities that support personally and emotionally resonant civic learning experiences with new media for adolescents in the hospital and beyond.\n\n# Methods for Emotionally Resonant Pedagogy and Study Implementation\n\nInterested in civic media learning as a social, affective experience, RtoT pushes the boundaries of social design experiments in which educational programs are considered “open systems that are subject to revision, disruptions, and contradictions and are co-designed”(Gutiérrez and Vossoughi 2009, 102). With the goal of expanding social design methods to attend more closely to affect, program implementation focused on intersections between researchers’ emerging feelings and participants’ desires to tell stories about their experiences. For example, researchers reflected on their able-bodied nervousness about adolescents’ desires to share feelings about mortality, felt those stories’ potential to inspire self-care, and followed the stories to their publication on YouTube, choosing not to allow their tentativeness to dampen patients’ desires to tell. Thus, moments of affective intensities were focal points in analysis and program development (Hollett and Christian Ehret 2014): research and pedagogy worked side by side to develop and understand adolescent’s desires for civic media production.\n\n# Austin: A Case of Affectively Engaged Civic Media Production\n\nAt sixteen, Austin has undergone routine hospitalizations for most of his life. A genetic disease, CF affects Austin’s respiratory system and his ability to absorb nutrients from food. As a result, he undergoes respiratory treatment in the hospital for two-week periods at least twice a year. Early in the project, Austin expressed the desire to develop a “better” website for learning about CF while he showed researchers popular websites he considered “uninformative.” These sites were adult-driven with little more than the information about which he was already expert, having been treated by adults for his CF all of his life. Moreover, the sites, developed by adults for an adolescent audience, sounded like adult entreaties aimed at kids telling them to “take care of themselves.”\n\nAlternatively, Austin showed researchers YouTube videos teens had uploaded in which they described what it was like to live with CF (Figure 1). Not having much, or any, physical contact with other teens living with the same condition, Austin found this teen-perspective especially impactful. One YouTuber, hollyrosanna, moved him especially. He compared how her skin color, which evinced a bluishness connected to oxygen depletion, revealed the progression of her CF in a way that he thought adult-driven websites elided. On those sites, he said, teens living with CF were not visibly ill. Austin continued playing videos in which hollyrosanna described in detail how she managed CF, her social life, and her first year at university. He ruminated on her appearance, connected to his own, and pondered what it might be like to go to college and manage life on his own.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_2M8bd-x5zhSAcZT4EnuPRQ.png)\n\nA few days after exploring these videos together, the RtoT team collaborated with him to make a YouTube video. They started a private YouTube channel on which they imagined other patients could share experiences important to them, or, as Austin put it, experiences that “only other CFers would understand” (Figure 2). In Austin’s first video he focused on how to develop trust in friendships, when to tell friends about CF, and how to manage just ‘hanging out’ with other kids, e.g., when peers’ smoking puts his fragile respiratory system at risk.\n\n&gt; &gt; Austin felt that these were the most important social issues to discuss with other teens living with CF because they are not otherwise addressed on adult-driven sites, yet they are most salient in his everyday life as a high school teen.\n\nThe RtoT team initially felt that guiding him in telling these stories was emotionally risky.

Research suggests, however, that many teachers avoid these types of classroom discussions because they feel ill equipped to deal with complex social and political issues and the unpredictability of student reactions. Further challenges include fear of repercussions and significant curriculum and time constraints (Hess, n.d.; Oulton, Dillon, and Grace 2004, 500). In addition, many students also refrain from participating in class discussions due to shyness, fears of being judged by peers, having insufficient time to think about their positions and large classroom sizes (Dutt-Doner and Powers 2000, 160; Hess 2001; Lusk and Weinberg 1994).</p>\n<p>To overcome these barriers, scholars have argued that online networks provide new opportunities for political discussion and venues for civic education (Bennett 2008, 11; Bennett, Wells, and Rank 2008, 116; Carpini, and X. 2000, 347; Middaugh and Kahne 2009, 212). One advantage of online dialogue over classroom discussion is that by responding and posting in the written form students are more accountable for how they present their positions than in a traditional classroom context. Students also report feeling more comfortable sharing their views online because discussions are more centered on the quality of arguments rather than the author. In addition, in an asynchronous dialogue students have more time at their disposal in which to ponder and formulate their own responses (Ghodarti and Gruba 2011, 443; Johnson 2001, 51; Meyer 2003, 56).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, civic education researchers and educators are increasingly calling for a more global conception of citizenship, grounded in the ability to engage in dialogue on social and political issues on an international level (Blades and Richardson; Merryfield, Lo, Po and Kasai 2008).

Upon registration, students accept to adhere to certain norms of communication, which help maintain an open and respectful interaction. Teachers and students also have full privacy control. Students may, for example, determine whether their individual posts are publically available or only seen by certain classes or their teacher.

Students can also develop media-literacy skills by exploring a variety of sources that discuss their topic of interest, from academic journals to mainstream media and blogs. Within the site, teachers are encouraged to coordinate assignments with other teachers through the “teachers’ forum.” This type of collaboration ensures a sustained contact between students from different classes and possibly from different countries; such interactions aid in the development of open-mindedness and tolerance.

For students who opt to have their postings publically available, the open facing front page can motivate them to develop their public voice and consider their audience as they write about and comment on the contemporary issues that effect them.</p>\n<p>Finally, NewsActivist has built-in features that facilitate collaboration and course management. The “teachers’ forum” provides a space for teachers to share resources and identify collaborators, while consultants are available to help teachers design and integrate assignments that use NewsActivist to meet particular curricular goals.

As within a classroom context, educators should ensure that norms of communication are established and respected in these dialogues. Educators may want to work with students to identify the conflicting values and pre-existing inequalities at the source of many social issues. This analysis will encourage students to disentangle themselves from their personal opinions and gain a wider perspective as they participate in online exchanges with students from outside the borders of their classroom.

Despite some encouraging progress, this still persists.</p>\n<p>Alongside popular cultural representations of marginalized groups, the UK political landscape provides a harsh backdrop of austerity and on-going cuts to welfare and disability benefits. Those claiming disability benefits in the UK have found themselves under attack from sections of the press, who are peddling an agenda of benefit fraud and waste (Briant et al 2011). “With statutory services being cut and increasingly focused solely on those in most critical need,” ADTV CEO, Jonathan Waddington-Jones argues, “there are growing numbers of disabled people, older people and their caretakers who are unable to access the support they need to live independently, healthily, and with dignity. Many, whether in rural or urban areas, are isolated from peer support and lack opportunities for civic engagement.” Indeed, much of the problem for many disabled and older people is access and voice in the media — being able to offer counter narratives to those in the mainstream.</p>\n<p>ADTV was conceived in 2013 to overcome these challenges of exclusion by creating a participatory platform of otherwise marginalized voices that communicate directly to diverse networked publics. Citizen journalism in this form holds the potential to empower ordinary citizens to connect with their communities. Hyperlocal initiatives based on a narrowly defined geographic specificity arise, according to Metzgar, Kurpius, &amp; Rowley (2011), due to the “public’s dissatisfaction with legacy media” and as an “attempt to fill the perceived gap in public affairs coverage” (Metzgar, Kurpius, and Rowley 2011, 782). Examples abound where disadvantaged or marginalized groups have adopted different forms of citizen journalism in this way to challenge their own civic exclusion — such as feminist movements, repressed indigenous people, or increasingly globalized social movements (Allan and Thorsen 2009, Thorsen and Allan 2014).</p>\n<p>For Access Dorset, the core issues were to foster enhanced community cohesion, address issues of representation and participation, and finally challenge the political landscape. Outputs from the ADTV project have primarily been video based, with stories reflecting the different interests and motivations of participants. Videos produced can broadly be classified as 1) information and lifestyle, 2) campaign and advocacy, and 3) reportage on marginalized issues. Participants have made videos about <a href=\"http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org/videos/healthy-living-videos/me-my-dad-and-prostate-cancer-part-1/\">living with cancer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org/videos/home-videos/hard-to-swallow/\">anorexia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org/videos/home-videos/has-your-fridge-got-the-message/\">emergency medical treatment for older people</a>, <a href=\"http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org/videos/home-videos/inappropriate-drop-kerb/\">inaccessible footpaths for disabled people</a>, and overcoming <a href=\"http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org/videos/home-videos/try-being-me-for-a-week-naomis-story/\">attitudinal barriers</a> to disability to name a few.</p>\n<p>ADTV has evidently had a positive impact on the participating citizen journalists and their ability to vocalize concerns, even within its first year of operation.

Since Access Dorset is an umbrella organization for various local and regional charities, these workshops brought together people with very different backgrounds, ages, and disabilities.

For them, it was not only about gaining access to the modes of production, but also making a difference through a creative project about their disabilities. Participants in ADTV are actively self-identifying as citizen journalists. Referring to professional journalists, one person observed how “their motivations are completely different.” (Participant A, interview) She expressed that they valued their own “freedom,” reporting on “issues that are directly affecting you on a local level, on a personal level and from the perspective of a person living everyday life rather than from the perspective of media trying to sell it.” (Participant A, interview) Another Bournemouth resident and Access Dorset citizen journalist, made a similar distinction, based in part on the participants’ experiences of mainstream reporters:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “But when you’re on your own, a reporter comes into your life and then he fucks off.

They felt they could be targeted. “Historically in Dorset, disabled people have been very passive because they are frightened they are going to lose their care,” Participant B commented, “so they’ve always remained not expressing any desire to challenge anything.” Participating in ADTV and the journalism workshops helped some overcome these barriers by working alongside those more experienced at trying to engender change.</p>\n<p>One of the most high profile reports supports a campaign to make a local railway station accessible for disabled people.

Your Story Goes Here is an online teaching kit offering guidance on creating digital stories or narratives that can empower citizens to contribute meaningfully to city building dialogues. At consultation meetings between citizens and urban planners, these types of narratives help articulate a community’s vision for a particular development site, a neighborhood, a park, or a well-used street corner. Your Story Goes Here offers practical steps for telling effective stories while also drawing on a conceptual framework that probes the idea of public space, considers the role of narratives in urban planning, and leverages the affordances of digital media as an engagement tool. This framework enriches the storytelling experience for kit users and deepens the practice of creating digital stories that contribute to the city building process.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Your Story Goes Here is built on the open source Mozilla Webmaker teaching kit platform, an easily sharable and highly customizable website building resource. Community groups and workshop facilitators can use the original version of the Your Story Goes Here teaching kit or are welcome to remix the content to produce their own versions.</p>\n<p>Through completing the five teaching kit activities, users learn to create a digital multimedia story about a particular space or place using video, photographs, audio, or another medium of choice. As the teaching kit is designed for individuals without urban planning expertise, it begins with a brief introduction on how citizens can become engaged in city building by seeking out community planning groups and by sharing stories with neighbors. Ideally, participants follow the activities sequentially; however, the modular design of the teaching kit also allows for a reconfiguration of the storytelling process.</p>\n<p>The first three activities are divided into paired sections — a thinking activity involving creative thought and a doing activity requiring kit users to explore their outside environment. To make storytelling more manageable for novices, the activities revolve around the creation of 10 keywords that describe the place where the digital story will be set. These keywords, which are created in the first activity set, provide a narrative framework on which kit users or ‘citizen planners’ can build their story. Once the keywords have been selected, and participants have gained a better understanding of the components of a digital story, they are encouraged to travel to their story setting to conduct a location audit (Peyton). In this activity, users reflect on why their location is a good place to be in — or what features make it unfriendly. In our beta testing of the kit activities, much time was spent on watching how the location was used and how people traversed the space; on recording the wind, light, sound, and other conditions; and on recording the many details of the physical environment that contribute to a more effective urban planning story. After the storytellers have captured their video, sound, or still images on location, the next set of activities explains the storyboarding process and presents options for choosing one of several ‘storytelling machines’(Transom) — websites for creating multimedia stories. Concluding activities focus on how stories can be shared in the planning context, both locally and through social media. Throughout the kit, participants are prompted to pause and consider the storytelling process. Creating reflective practitioners (Schön 1987) is fundamental to Your Story Goes Here, as the kit aims to help participants crystallize thoughts and ideas about the development of neighborhood spaces and the design of resilient cities.</p>\n<p>Urban planning processes differ widely from city to city; thus Your Story Goes Here provides a descriptive framework for creating and sharing digital stories rather than a detailed, prescriptive method. The kit functions as a thought-starter for citizens who want to engage in city building, but are unsure of how non-experts can participate in an often bureaucratic process. Each activity includes additional resources and references to encourage users to explore the possibilities of storytelling in their particular city building context, while the openness of the Mozilla Webmaker platform enables individuals with basic web skills to use the kit’s framework while adding their own content.</p>\n<p>Your Story Goes Here is designed for small groups of five or less, developing stories in a facilitated workshop setting. Typically, it is more rewarding if each group member assumes a particular role; for instance, writer, director, videographer or photographer, and editor. Although the kit is targeted at a broad audience, potential users include youth groups, high school and university students, and community planning groups. The kit was initially tested with the latter, and graduate students will use a remixed version in a Fall 2014 course on design and wayfinding. Although Your Story Goes Here uses free storytelling tools, it requires potential participants to have access to some form of digital recording technology such as a camera or smart phone, an Internet connection, and the ability to use web-based multimedia tools.</p>\n<p>Your Story Goes Here is rooted in the essentiality of public space within the built environment. These shared, walkable spaces are “where meaning is made, shaping lives and sense of community” (Sanders 2009). For people to become active stewards of common areas they must be able to articulate the importance of public space and to identify how urban development affects the physical and emotional lives of citizens. The “story turn” (Sandercock 2010) in urban planning offers one way for citizens to share their viewpoints, and to become purposefully engaged in city building. Digital storytelling, as imagined here and by numerous other organizations (e.g. DIY Days, Center for Digital Storytelling) is taking its place as a legitimate tool for civic engagement. City building is a complex, and often disenfranchising, process.

Your Story Goes Here is an online teaching kit offering guidance on creating digital stories or narratives that can empower citizens to contribute meaningfully to city building dialogues. At consultation meetings between citizens and urban planners, these types of narratives help articulate a community’s vision for a particular development site, a neighborhood, a park, or a well-used street corner. Your Story Goes Here offers practical steps for telling effective stories while also drawing on a conceptual framework that probes the idea of public space, considers the role of narratives in urban planning, and leverages the affordances of digital media as an engagement tool. This framework enriches the storytelling experience for kit users and deepens the practice of creating digital stories that contribute to the city building process.\n\n&gt; &gt; Your Story Goes Here is built on the open source Mozilla Webmaker teaching kit platform, an easily sharable and highly customizable website building resource. Community groups and workshop facilitators can use the original version of the Your Story Goes Here teaching kit or are welcome to remix the content to produce their own versions.\n\nThrough completing the five teaching kit activities, users learn to create a digital multimedia story about a particular space or place using video, photographs, audio, or another medium of choice. As the teaching kit is designed for individuals without urban planning expertise, it begins with a brief introduction on how citizens can become engaged in city building by seeking out community planning groups and by sharing stories with neighbors. Ideally, participants follow the activities sequentially; however, the modular design of the teaching kit also allows for a reconfiguration of the storytelling process.\n\nThe first three activities are divided into paired sections — a thinking activity involving creative thought and a doing activity requiring kit users to explore their outside environment. To make storytelling more manageable for novices, the activities revolve around the creation of 10 keywords that describe the place where the digital story will be set. These keywords, which are created in the first activity set, provide a narrative framework on which kit users or ‘citizen planners’ can build their story. Once the keywords have been selected, and participants have gained a better understanding of the components of a digital story, they are encouraged to travel to their story setting to conduct a location audit (Peyton). In this activity, users reflect on why their location is a good place to be in — or what features make it unfriendly. In our beta testing of the kit activities, much time was spent on watching how the location was used and how people traversed the space; on recording the wind, light, sound, and other conditions; and on recording the many details of the physical environment that contribute to a more effective urban planning story. After the storytellers have captured their video, sound, or still images on location, the next set of activities explains the storyboarding process and presents options for choosing one of several ‘storytelling machines’(Transom) — websites for creating multimedia stories. Concluding activities focus on how stories can be shared in the planning context, both locally and through social media. Throughout the kit, participants are prompted to pause and consider the storytelling process. Creating reflective practitioners (Schön 1987) is fundamental to Your Story Goes Here, as the kit aims to help participants crystallize thoughts and ideas about the development of neighborhood spaces and the design of resilient cities.\n\nUrban planning processes differ widely from city to city; thus Your Story Goes Here provides a descriptive framework for creating and sharing digital stories rather than a detailed, prescriptive method. The kit functions as a thought-starter for citizens who want to engage in city building, but are unsure of how non-experts can participate in an often bureaucratic process. Each activity includes additional resources and references to encourage users to explore the possibilities of storytelling in their particular city building context, while the openness of the Mozilla Webmaker platform enables individuals with basic web skills to use the kit’s framework while adding their own content.\n\nYour Story Goes Here is designed for small groups of five or less, developing stories in a facilitated workshop setting. Typically, it is more rewarding if each group member assumes a particular role; for instance, writer, director, videographer or photographer, and editor. Although the kit is targeted at a broad audience, potential users include youth groups, high school and university students, and community planning groups. The kit was initially tested with the latter, and graduate students will use a remixed version in a Fall 2014 course on design and wayfinding. Although Your Story Goes Here uses free storytelling tools, it requires potential participants to have access to some form of digital recording technology such as a camera or smart phone, an Internet connection, and the ability to use web-based multimedia tools.\n\nYour Story Goes Here is rooted in the essentiality of public space within the built environment. These shared, walkable spaces are “where meaning is made, shaping lives and sense of community” (Sanders 2009). For people to become active stewards of common areas they must be able to articulate the importance of public space and to identify how urban development affects the physical and emotional lives of citizens. The “story turn” (Sandercock 2010) in urban planning offers one way for citizens to share their viewpoints, and to become purposefully engaged in city building. Digital storytelling, as imagined here and by numerous other organizations (e.g. DIY Days, Center for Digital Storytelling) is taking its place as a legitimate tool for civic engagement. City building is a complex, and often disenfranchising, process. By leveraging freely available online tools, Your Story Goes Here aims to empower citizen planners through the digital alchemy of storytelling.\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/479842125_1280.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/98955966)\nA detailed overview of the teaching kit activities.\n\n# Additional Links\n\nTo look through and use _Your Story Goes Here_, visit [here](http://www.citizensinplanning.com/) or [here](https://urbanstorytellers.makes.org/thimble/MzY3OTE5MTA0/urban-storytelling-a-how-to-guide-start-here).\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nPeyton, Tom. “Project for Public Spaces | The Placemaker’s Guide to Transportation: Street Audit.” Accessed June 28, 2014.

Through their use of email and social media, 38 Degrees mobilizes its geographically dispersed membership across sedimentary networks: loose affiliations of digitally connected individuals that periodically come together to act across a diverse range of issue campaigns (Chadwick and Dennis 2014). The group has achieved significant policy change, most notably in their campaign to halt the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government’s plans to sell off public forests in 2011 (Chatterton 2011).</p>\n<p>38 Degrees bears little resemblance to the organizational models that scholars in political science have become accustomed to. Unlike political parties or traditional pressure groups, its members play an important role in directing the movement’s day-to-day decision making. Essentially, the organization acts as a conduit for its membership, removing the layers of elite-level decision-making that characterized political groups of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>Members are responsible for a number of decisions made throughout each campaign. During the recent campaign to compel a leading energy provider to pay more tax, members were consulted on whether the movement should launch the campaign, their ideas were sought for potential campaign tactics and, as shown in Figure 1, they were given the final say as to whether or not 38 Degrees should try to organize a mass, “people-powered” switch away from the energy provider to alternative suppliers. By using digital tools that are diffused widely amongst its membership, members are able to express their opinion and set the movement’s priorities very quickly on an unprecedented scale. For those involved, this is a clear and visible way of exerting their influence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_zmEPC3qXxosLdAKYOvn4Ng.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: “Npower: 48 Hrs to Vote” (Babbs 2013).\"></p>\n<p>However, it is important to emphasize that 38 Degrees is not an example of “organizing without organizations” (Shirky 2008). The staff, based in the organization’s central London office, performs a gatekeeping role and have an enhanced level of influence over the design and selection of campaign actions. Yet, equally, this is not an elite-dominated hierarchy masquerading as being member-driven. The movement relies on the central office to assimilate the priorities of its members and then offer repertoires of engagement. As such, the movement’s overall direction is decided by its membership. Paolo Gerbaudo (2012) describes this as “soft leadership”; the staff organizes and structures campaigns whilst minimizing their encroachment on the will of each individual member.</p>\n<p>Karpf (2012) proposes to consider this as characteristic of a new type of organization. These new organizations challenge our traditional conceptions of collective action, as they are structurally fluid. 38 Degrees — like GetUp! in Australia (Vromen and Coleman 2014) and MoveOn in the United States — is an example of a “hybrid mobilization movement,” using the internet to adapt and transform its organizational structure and repertoire of actions during campaigns in real-time (Chadwick 2007, 283). 38 Degrees lacks the bureaucratic structures that make rapid structural change difficult for traditional organizations. By virtue of its structural fluidity and through constant monitoring of members’ attitudes, the organisation is able to strategically adapt and respond to current events, riding the groundswell of enthusiasm and interest that surrounds current affairs (Chadwick 2013, 193). It is this responsivity, coupled with the organization’s fluid structure, which is central to the cultivation of a sense of proximity for the membership, a vital characteristic given its diffuse and networked structure.</p>\n<p>A critique frequently leveled at 38 Degrees is that its campaigns amount to little more than clicktivism, low-threshold forms of political engagement online that are perceived to have an insignificant effect on political outcomes (Rickett 2013). It is important to note that the repertoire of actions used by 38 Degrees is not limited to e-petitions or hashtag activism. The organization employs a range of online and real-space engagement repertoires that vary depending on the campaign aims. In the recent campaign to stop the passage of the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill, otherwise known as the “gagging law” members were initially tasked with sending an email to Chloe Smith MP, the minister responsible for the bill. The intensity of member participation increased as the campaign progressed, culminating in a rally outside the Houses of Parliament (see Figure 2).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_7K-VQDyirobfRrCv2mkJgg.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: Activists protesting against the “gagging law.”\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; When examined in isolation, examples of so-called clicktivism may seem trivial. However, these low-threshold digital acts form an important part of an architecture of participation in which the interdependency between different acts sheds light on the normative value of one’s democratic engagement</p>\n<p>(Chadwick and Dennis 2014). For example, in the campaign to pressure a clothes manufacturer to pay compensation to the affected families of the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, the first action launched was an e-petition — a common practice for most 38 Degrees campaigns. By collating email addresses through an online petition, the central office are able to mobilize a network of engaged members, some of whom will then take part in further activism; in this case a series of localized protests at the company’s stores (Torabi 2014).</p>\n<p>It is true that the actions designed by the central office often require small amounts of effort, or more precisely time; they are designed with this in mind. By making campaign actions granular, the organization lowers the barrier of entry to political participation. Past studies have highlighted that the democratic benefits accrued through use of the internet tend to be skewed in favor of affluent, well-educated, and politically informed citizens (Brundidge and Rice 2009; Mossberger, Tolbert and Stansbury 2003). However, 38 Degrees try to buck these trends by enabling non-activists to take action in spheres traditionally controlled by political professionals.</p>\n<p>When considering the time pressure that individuals experience on a daily basis, the granularity of digital engagement represents an important means of maintaining awareness — keeping a toe in the water so to speak — sometimes sparking further involvement at opportune moments. These moments tend to revolve around personal context. The membership of 38 Degrees is not tied into one fixed ideology, but instead individuals pick and choose the issue campaigns to which they relate. Individually expressive frames displace more traditional, collective action frames, in what Bennett and Segerberg (2013) describe as “personal action frames.” Political participation is therefore self-motivating, as political acts are akin to personal expression.</p>\n<p>What is most striking about the movement is its organizational ethos, “People. Power. Change.” Individual empowerment is at the heart of the movement. In line with those who argue that citizenship is increasingly personally-defined rather than institutionally-derived, and that engagement is focused around issues of importance to the individual rather than coherent ideologies (Dalton 2008; Pattie, Seyd and Whiteley 2004, 275), the successes of 38 Degrees comes down to how the organization maximizes the membership’s sense of efficacy; the feeling that each individual member has, or can have, an impact. The movement offers what people want from their political participation — influence and tangible efficacy, rather than rigid ideological platforms and unresponsive hierarchies.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Babbs, David. 2013. “NPOWER: 48 HRS TO VOTE.” 38 Degrees.

Participants explored various lifeworlds by responding to and authoring multimodal poetry. In #WalkMyWorld, educators and students created a social space of engagement to explore civic uses of social media. This exploration served as an opportunity to consider the media literacies at play as the group participated as a community of writers.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; In this project, the participants collectively engaged as researchers and multimodal composers through narrative inquiry as an analytic and philosophical framework to model civic engagement with digital words and worlds.</p>\n<p>This project also encouraged educators and students in elementary school through higher education to engage in social scholarship practices. Social scholarship utilizes the Internet and other communication technologies to evolve the ways in which scholarship is conducted. Like many other social scholarship projects #WalkMyWorld connected formal scholarship with informal Internet-based social practices while embodying specific values (e.g., openness, collaboration, transparency, access, sharing). #WalkMyWorld evolved into a space that allowed participants to explore the characteristics of online information and educational opportunities by allowing them to share and develop (a) writing lifeworlds, (b) communities of inquiry, (c) media literacies and (d) expanded perspectives of narrative writing. These skills have proven to be integral to the way teachers view themselves as professionals in online and hybrid educational spaces.</p>\n<h1 id=\"settings-and-participants\">Settings and Participants</h1>\n<p>The #WalkMyWorld project took the form of a hybrid learning experience in which educators and students collaborated, discussed, and shared in online and offline spaces.

The practices participants engaged in proved integral to the way they viewed themselves as professionals in online and hybrid educational spaces. Teachers worked collectively online to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to construct online information. Students expressed themselves and their identities as educators to act as critical readers and writers of online information. Affordances and understanding of specific digital texts and tools provided some challenges as teachers worked to complete the goals of the project #WalkMyWorld also allowed students to reconsider the spaces of learning. By utilizing principles of social scholarship the project exposed participants to various lifeworlds through multiple modes. This provided a greater opportunity to communicate and model civic engagement with the world at large, noting specifically that no learner can passively engage with others because the “spaces for community life where local and specific meaning can be made” are collaborative civic centers viewed, modified, and analyzed by all. The spaces of #WalkMyWorld were also transparent. The applied mediums emphasized the importance of using open technologies to make information readily available.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Bolter, J.

Among the themes taken up on Twitter and in other social networks, there has been an intense discussion of sexism, especially in the past several years (see also #YesAllWomen). In the German-speaking area, #aufschrei became the Twitter message of the year 2013, the hashtag collecting and sharing sexist experiences. Similarly in the English-speaking areas the hashtags #shoutingback and #EverydaySexism performed the same function. Referring to theories of the public sphere which argue for a multiplicity of publics (cf. Fraser 2005), our contribution is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the tweets on #aufschrei, and presents its main results. We are especially interested in the following questions: How is sexism discussed on Twitter? And which alternative publics are created by online feminist protest?</p>\n<h1 id=\"online-publics-as-counter-publics\">Online Publics as Counter-Publics</h1>\n<p>Partial publics and counter-publics on the Internet can create intervention opportunities for marginalized groups, which are able to concentrate and mobilize their common interests. Nancy Fraser (2005), in particular, pointed out that regardless of their participation in dis-cursive processes, social movements and counter publics are not included in the traditional model of the public sphere. She opposes Habermas’ ideal of a singular bourgeois public sphere and stresses the existence of numerous counter or subaltern publics. Groups within society that are affected by decisions should, in principle, have the opportunity to negotiate these decisions publicly. With the Internet, the existence of plural publics has become more evident, and they are more visible. Here, new relationships between mass media publics and everyday publics, which emerge from spontaneous encounters, are constituted. Further-more, social movements, subcultures and counter-publics have gained new forums for meeting and communicating.</p>\n<h1 id=\"aufschrei-a-twitter-campaign-against-sexism-in-germany\">#aufschrei: A Twitter Campaign Against Sexism in Germany</h1>\n<p>“We should collect our experiences under a hashtag. I suggest aufschrei” — with this tweet Anne Wizorek initiated together with Nicole von Horst a wide-ranging debate on forms of sexism in everyday life in the German-speaking areas on the evening of January 24, 2013. Alone on the day following the start of the message, 38,387 Tweets were sent as replies. Within the first four days, roughly <a href=\"http://www.soviet.tv/blog/2013/01/der-aufschrei-daten-dump/\">17,000 different people were active on #aufschrei.</a> The followers of the hashtag and the further links pointed to numerous actors who form a net-work, which generates attention for Twitter (cf. Maireder/Schlögl 2014). Also in the traditional mass media, mainly in the first months, there had been coverage and continuing de-bates on sexism (cf. Gsenger/Thiele 2014).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3c4UMnX7ig\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/B3c4UMnX7ig/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a></p>\n<p>Our study comprises a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the tweets on #aufschrei. The sampling unit is made up of all tweets posted under the hashtag #aufschrei. An analysis period of seven weeks was chosen, that is, from the start of the hashtag on January 25, 2013 until March 14, 2013. We formed an artificial week as a control sample and through random selection designated 100 tweets per day, that is, a total of 700 tweets that were deemed the unit for analysis. Such a selection naturally limits the generalizability of the results. Still, due to the recurring argumentation structures and contexts in the results, it can be assumed that the tweets that were not examined may have had similar patterns.</p>\n<p>In the quantitative analysis it turned out that most tweets described personal experiences of everyday sexism.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; It is obvious that sexism is prevalent in the day-to-day life of many women, and that it affects various areas of life and work.</p>\n<p>However, there were almost no references to multiple forms of discrimination, for example, based on categories of race or sexuality. From the second week, there was a steady presence of anti-feminist tweets that contained a lot of name-calling and sexist words. The qualitative analysis of the tweets yielded that the tweets reporting on sexist experiences can be organized in terms of participating actors, situations (time and location), and types of assault. Such incidents are thereby part of social structures, as especially hierarchies are exploited in the practice of forms of sexism. At the same time, however, physical incidents — and not only verbal forms of sexism — shape many people’s experiences of this form of prejudice. Nonetheless, #aufschrei is also used as a plat-form for sexist and anti-feminist statements. In these statements, for the most part, clichés and stereotypes are reproduced and the structural dimensions of sexism trivialized. Anti-feminist and masculinity positions are not new phenomena; however, through the Internet they have found new forms for agitation, distribution, and networking (cf. Klaus 2008).</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion-twitter-as-a-feminist-counter-public\">Conclusion: Twitter as a Feminist Counter-Public?</h1>\n<p>As the #aufschrei campaign shows, it is necessary to achieve different layers of the public sphere in order to devolve a mobilizing power. Initially, within a protest movement, these layers comprise the “movement culture.” That is, the networks, spaces, and personal relationships of the actors; as well as the “movement public,” which constitutes a counter public with autonomous communication structures, mobilization resources, organization and gathering publicity, as well as movement-specific media — with the goal of reaching the hegemonic public (cf. Wischermann 2003; Klaus 2006). Twitter takes over the function of a simple public, in which sexist experiences are collected and an exchange of knowledge takes place; and which nonetheless is simultaneously connected with a “movement public,” that forms through further hashtags, feminist blogs, and also feminist media. Through the narration of personal experiences and negotiation processes dealing with sexism in general, a critical position is developed and with that, public criticism formulated. This is the requirement for reaching the hegemonic public sphere.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the Internet undoubtedly offers new opportunities for discussion, exchange of knowledge and experiences, and for the creation of local and transnational networks. All the same, it also copies and reproduces social structures and content that are present in every-day life. The Internet’s, in principle openness, also enables sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and right-wing use. Thus, this public sphere does not offer a protected space: anti-feminist and sexist comments are equally visible and might possibly mean new experiences of violence for women. Even so, diverse (queer-) feminist protest and organization forms and media can be observed. Feminist interventions with critical, political, and solidarity-based approaches — such as #aufschrei — are important as they depict feminism as a lived and political everyday practice.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References:</h1>\n<p>Fraser, Nancy. “Transnationalizing the Public Sphere.” Accessed May 20, 2014. <a href=\"http://www.republicart.net/disc/publicum/fraser01_en.pdf\">http://www.republicart.net/disc/publicum/fraser01_en.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>Gsenger, Marlene/Thiele, Martina. 2014. “Wird der #aufschrei erhört?

Among the themes taken up on Twitter and in other social networks, there has been an intense discussion of sexism, especially in the past several years (see also #YesAllWomen). In the German-speaking area, #aufschrei became the Twitter message of the year 2013, the hashtag collecting and sharing sexist experiences. Similarly in the English-speaking areas the hashtags #shoutingback and #EverydaySexism performed the same function. Referring to theories of the public sphere which argue for a multiplicity of publics (cf. Fraser 2005), our contribution is based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the tweets on #aufschrei, and presents its main results. We are especially interested in the following questions: How is sexism discussed on Twitter? And which alternative publics are created by online feminist protest?\n\n# Online Publics as Counter-Publics\n\nPartial publics and counter-publics on the Internet can create intervention opportunities for marginalized groups, which are able to concentrate and mobilize their common interests. Nancy Fraser (2005), in particular, pointed out that regardless of their participation in dis-cursive processes, social movements and counter publics are not included in the traditional model of the public sphere. She opposes Habermas’ ideal of a singular bourgeois public sphere and stresses the existence of numerous counter or subaltern publics. Groups within society that are affected by decisions should, in principle, have the opportunity to negotiate these decisions publicly. With the Internet, the existence of plural publics has become more evident, and they are more visible. Here, new relationships between mass media publics and everyday publics, which emerge from spontaneous encounters, are constituted. Further-more, social movements, subcultures and counter-publics have gained new forums for meeting and communicating.\n\n# #aufschrei: A Twitter Campaign Against Sexism in Germany\n\n“We should collect our experiences under a hashtag. I suggest aufschrei” — with this tweet Anne Wizorek initiated together with Nicole von Horst a wide-ranging debate on forms of sexism in everyday life in the German-speaking areas on the evening of January 24, 2013. Alone on the day following the start of the message, 38,387 Tweets were sent as replies. Within the first four days, roughly [17,000 different people were active on #aufschrei.](http://www.soviet.tv/blog/2013/01/der-aufschrei-daten-dump/) The followers of the hashtag and the further links pointed to numerous actors who form a net-work, which generates attention for Twitter (cf. Maireder/Schlögl 2014). Also in the traditional mass media, mainly in the first months, there had been coverage and continuing de-bates on sexism (cf. Gsenger/Thiele 2014).\n\n[![Youtube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/B3c4UMnX7ig/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3c4UMnX7ig)\n\nOur study comprises a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the tweets on #aufschrei. The sampling unit is made up of all tweets posted under the hashtag #aufschrei. An analysis period of seven weeks was chosen, that is, from the start of the hashtag on January 25, 2013 until March 14, 2013. We formed an artificial week as a control sample and through random selection designated 100 tweets per day, that is, a total of 700 tweets that were deemed the unit for analysis. Such a selection naturally limits the generalizability of the results. Still, due to the recurring argumentation structures and contexts in the results, it can be assumed that the tweets that were not examined may have had similar patterns.\n\nIn the quantitative analysis it turned out that most tweets described personal experiences of everyday sexism.\n\n&gt; &gt; It is obvious that sexism is prevalent in the day-to-day life of many women, and that it affects various areas of life and work.\n\nHowever, there were almost no references to multiple forms of discrimination, for example, based on categories of race or sexuality. From the second week, there was a steady presence of anti-feminist tweets that contained a lot of name-calling and sexist words. The qualitative analysis of the tweets yielded that the tweets reporting on sexist experiences can be organized in terms of participating actors, situations (time and location), and types of assault. Such incidents are thereby part of social structures, as especially hierarchies are exploited in the practice of forms of sexism. At the same time, however, physical incidents — and not only verbal forms of sexism — shape many people’s experiences of this form of prejudice. Nonetheless, #aufschrei is also used as a plat-form for sexist and anti-feminist statements. In these statements, for the most part, clichés and stereotypes are reproduced and the structural dimensions of sexism trivialized. Anti-feminist and masculinity positions are not new phenomena; however, through the Internet they have found new forms for agitation, distribution, and networking (cf. Klaus 2008).\n\n# Conclusion: Twitter as a Feminist Counter-Public?\n\nAs the #aufschrei campaign shows, it is necessary to achieve different layers of the public sphere in order to devolve a mobilizing power. Initially, within a protest movement, these layers comprise the “movement culture.” That is, the networks, spaces, and personal relationships of the actors; as well as the “movement public,” which constitutes a counter public with autonomous communication structures, mobilization resources, organization and gathering publicity, as well as movement-specific media — with the goal of reaching the hegemonic public (cf. Wischermann 2003; Klaus 2006). Twitter takes over the function of a simple public, in which sexist experiences are collected and an exchange of knowledge takes place; and which nonetheless is simultaneously connected with a “movement public,” that forms through further hashtags, feminist blogs, and also feminist media. Through the narration of personal experiences and negotiation processes dealing with sexism in general, a critical position is developed and with that, public criticism formulated. This is the requirement for reaching the hegemonic public sphere.\n\nTo sum up, the Internet undoubtedly offers new opportunities for discussion, exchange of knowledge and experiences, and for the creation of local and transnational networks. All the same, it also copies and reproduces social structures and content that are present in every-day life. The Internet’s, in principle openness, also enables sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and right-wing use. Thus, this public sphere does not offer a protected space: anti-feminist and sexist comments are equally visible and might possibly mean new experiences of violence for women. Even so, diverse (queer-) feminist protest and organization forms and media can be observed. Feminist interventions with critical, political, and solidarity-based approaches — such as #aufschrei — are important as they depict feminism as a lived and political everyday practice.\n\n# References:\n\nFraser, Nancy. “Transnationalizing the Public Sphere.” Accessed May 20, 2014.

Both Olson and I have characterized the Patriots as censors, but from a different perspective they could be read as a determined minority mobilizing a fully sympathetic Get Out The Vote effort to “wake-up” other users and have their voices heard.\n\nThe story of the Digg Patriots, like any text, can be and in fact is read differently by different readers: how you feel about their mission and methods says rather less about the Patriots themselves than about how you believe digital civics should properly be practiced. The hotly contested case of the Patriots, along with many analogues across civic media, remind us that we have still not yet settled on a stable consensus on how these new sociotechnical systems ought to work, and ought to be worked, as critical levers of power in our emerging networked political apparatus.\n\n# References\n\nLacy, Sarah, and Jessi Hempel. “Valley Boys.” BusinessWeek: Magazine, August 13, 2006.\n\n[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-08-13/valley-boys/.](http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-08-13/valley-boys/.)\n\nOleOleOlso. 2010 “Massive Censorship of Digg Uncovered.” _Alternet_,\nAugust 5.

Understanding the nature of these grassroots projects, which, while in a state of constant flux, are able to distribute resources and deliver meaningful results, is crucial to further theorizing about the new, augmented reality of civil society and protest movements.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nBennett, W.

It went on to win acclaim as one of the most actionable ideas at the conference (Jaffe 2011). While Kick-Stopper was in development via a mailing list, Gokey has started working on a related idea for buying and forgiving debt with Adbusters’s Micah White (Gokey 2011b; White 2014). White had imagined the idea back in 2009, and later received input from David Graeber, who wrote about the history of debt forgiveness “jubilees” in his book Debt: The First 5,000 Years (White 2014).</p>\n<p>Back at Zuccotti Park, the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (OSDC) formed from assemblies involving sociologist and activist Andrew Ross (Larson and Smith 2014). Growing out of Occupy Wall Street’s Education &amp; Empowerment Working Group, OSDC developed a debt refusal pledge campaign, which they launched November 21, 2011. The idea was that signers pledged to default on their debt once one million other signers did the same. OSDC distributed the pledge and related information and collected stories of indebtedness through their website. Their focus on debt refusal as an explicit alternative strategy to legislative action differentiated OSDC from prior initiatives like Student Loan Justice (n.d.), and gained enough notoriety to merit the inclusion of their “debt strike” as a new tactic in Andrew Boyd’s Beautiful Trouble (Jaffe &amp; Skomorovsky 2012). However, the OSDC pledge was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>In response to OWS’s disaggregation after actions on May Day 2012, Occupy Theory, the working group of OWS publication Tidal held a series of assemblies in Washington Square Park. One of the early assemblies co-organized with OSDC and Free University was on Education and Debt in solidarity with student strikes in Montreal; it attracted many OWS affiliated organizers and participants looking at mortgages, education, or other debt-related and social justice issues (Hiscott 2013; Strike Debt 2014; Larson &amp; Smith 2014). The resonance of the assembly and subsequent conversations indicated to the organizers in attendance that there was common interest in broadening their analyses to look at the whole debt system (Larson &amp; Smith 2014). This was the genesis of Strike Debt.</p>\n<h1 id=\"building-the-movement\">Building the Movement</h1>\n<p>Strike Debt’s Facebook page was created June 6, and its website’s domain names were registered on June 11–12. Their first events were “debt assemblies” in parks, starting on June 11, 2012 in Washington Square Park (McKee 2012). The debt assemblies gave a safe space for debtors to come and share their stories of indebtedness and build community and solidarity. They also continued their analysis of the debt system, and started to draft the Debt Resister’s Operations Manual (DROM) to offer advice on how to escape all types of debt and urge individuals to join in collective action, in a debt resistance movement (Ross 2013).</p>\n<p>During Strike Debt’s first few weeks, a friend recommended to organizer Aaron Smith that he contact Gokey (Larson and Smith 2014). Smith and a former OSDC organizer who had previously spoke to Gokey invited him to travel from Syracuse and pitch his idea for buying debt on the secondary market, like debt collectors do, and then cancelling it (Ibid.). Despite reservations by other Strike Debt organizers who thought the idea was too capitalistic, they pushed ahead with meeting Gokey, hoping the tactic could at least raise awareness (Ibid.).</p>\n<p>By mid-July, the idea of the Rolling Jubilee, then known as the “debt fairy” campaign, was added to Strike Debt’s game plan (McKee 2012). From the beginning, they argued it was not an end-game strategy, as Strike Debt organizer Yates McKee noted in a July 13 essay,</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “While not a structural solution — and not applicable to student loans — scaled up it could become what David Graeber imagines as a “moving jubilee” capable of both garnering media attention around debtors’ struggles and taking business away from the intermediary companies that profit from hounding and penalizing those unable to pay.” (Ibid.)</p>\n<p>Gokey had already successfully tested the debt-buying idea using $500 of his own money. To effectively scale the action, Strike Debt reached out to lawyers and accountants for help with the details, and set a goal of raising $50,000 with the hope of buying $1M worth of debt at the going rate of ~5 cents on the dollar (Larson and Smith 2014).</p>\n<p>Strike Debt continued to organize debt assemblies over the summer (Ross 2013), building toward OWS’s anniversary on September 17, 2012 (S17), where they would officially launch the DROM. Strike Debt was deeply involved with the planning of and media activism around S17, where one of the “quadrants” was dedicated to the theme of “debt”; they hoped to unite Occupy Movement participants around the issue (Taylor 2012; Graeber 2012; Konczal 2012a).</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-rolling-jubilee-and-its-limits\">The Rolling Jubilee and its Limits</h1>\n<p>Following S17 and the launch of DROM, Strike Debt focused on planning a launch for the Rolling Jubilee to coincide with the November 15, 2012 anniversary of OWS’s eviction from Zuccotti Park. Its Facebook page had already been registered August 14, and its website’s domain names were registered September 26–27. On October 22, they shared a screenshot of the teaser page on their website via Facebook.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ER_JZv9UAqSGtHQwofpNhQ.png\" alt=\"Rolling Jubilee teaser page screenshot shared on Facebook, October 22, 2012\"></p>\n<p>Returning to the successful tactic of story sharing employed by OSDC and the debt assemblies, on October 29, Strike Debt started curating stories arguing for debt resistance on Tumblr. A larger social media bomb via Twitter and blogs was planned to launch the Rolling Jubilee using a mailing list of organizers from the Occupy Movement’s network of encampments — a strategy inspired in part by the Kony2012 campaign’s successful construction and activation of on-the-ground networks to make their video go “viral” (Larson and Smith 2014).</p>\n<p>The launch was designed as a “telethon” entitled “The People’s Bailout,” featuring musicians and comedians taking the stage and a livestream simulcast — all ticket proceeds went to the Rolling Jubilee fund and online donations were tallied with updates punctuating the acts. The social media bomb was planned for a week ahead of time. They created a promotional video and poster for the event, and drafted a press release for their network for promotional use. Unexpected social media success came on November 8 as co-organizer and co-host of the telethon David Rees posted the announcement to his well-followed Tumblr blog the night before the bomb; it piqued the interest of actor and writer Wil Wheaton who re-blogged it, putting the press release in front of his large audience of followers. Within 48 hours, the online donations surpassed the $50,000 goal (Larson and Smith 2014).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_TYDZdquyhWWK9b7BHZJtdA.png\" alt=\"The People’s Bailout, Rolling Jubilee “telethon” Poster\"></p>\n<p>By the end of its first push, the Rolling Jubilee took in $435,000 (Tepper 2012), well surpassing its goal. However, critics dismissed the Rolling Jubilee as a “gimmick,” arguing it was at a scale too small to have impact and was a distraction from more useful tactics like educating people about strategic bankruptcy (Henwood 2012; Smith 2012). They also questioned its ability to build a movement through debt forgiveness (Konczal 2012b). Strike Debt organizers reiterated that it was never meant to be a large-scale solution (Ross and Ackerman 2012; Ross and Taylor 2012), as McKee had noted early on. Instead, Ross and Taylor’s piece in The Nation emphasized that the Rolling Jubilee was “an act of solidarity and an opportunity for public education,” and introduced the broad set of debt resistance strategies and the long-term vision of a system of positive credit through mutual aid (2012).</p>\n<p>These response articles and interviews also publicized the creation of Strike Debt chapters in cities and on campuses across the country, inspired by the DROM (Ross and Taylor 2012; Tepper 2012). This is Strike Debt’s real end-game strategy: build a networked social movement around debt resistance by correcting the information asymmetry between the lenders and the indebted while promoting a wide variety of actions.</p>\n<p>The Rolling Jubilee stopped collecting donations on December 31, 2013. The donations totaled $701,317. And as of the writing of this case study, they had purchased and “abolished” $14,734,569.87, with one more jubilee announcement on the way. The first four debt purchases, detailed on the “Transparency” page of the Rolling Jubilee website, went to medical debt, the accrual of which is arguably rarely the fault of the debtor, which helps reinforce Strike Debt’s moral argument against the debt system.</p>\n<h1 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h1>\n<p>With the Rolling Jubilee ending, the Strike Debt organizers I spoke to in May 2014 say they will miss the massive media attention delivered by the debt buys, but they are eager to focus on creating a more sustainable structure for Strike Debt and building the on-the-ground network of debt resisters (Larson and Smith 2014). They want to grow the number of chapters, especially on college campuses, and get the DROM, which has been expanded into a full book, into more hands. They continue to analyze the debt system and write reports to support their intellectual and moral argument (Graeff and Bhargava 2014). Additionally, they are exploring new forms of action and public education, currently working with an NYU law student to develop “debt clinics” (Ibid.).</p>\n<h1 id=\"market-based-activism-media-activism-or-both\">Market-based Activism, Media Activism, or Both?</h1>\n<p>In his book Code and other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig contends that there are four ways contemporary society is regulated: law, norms, markets, and architecture (2006). Ethan Zuckerman argues that these also represent opportunities for citizens to affect change in complex systems by treating each of them as levers (2013). Strike Debt as a debt resistance movement and an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street has a particular focus on the market-based lever, generally used to punish corporations by affecting the cost of doing business. The goal of debt resistance as practice by Strike Debt is to undermine and destroy the system of lenders that prey on debtors, ideally drying up their market through non-participation. The Rolling Jubilee is a tactic that tried to subvert the system by using its own market structure to cancel debt. But as the organizers confess, this is symbolic; its utility is its ability to draw attention to the issue, like a creative event in the service of media activism.</p>\n<p>Analyzing Strike Debt’s tactics using Albert Hirschman’s framework of exit, voice, and loyalty, debt resistance looks like an exit from the relationship with big banks and the debt system (1970). This is the long-term goal of an alternative economy for mutual benefit. But this is not easy to achieve because of the laws, norms, markets, and architectures that govern the system and everyone who touches it. Thus, it becomes an exercise in voice, confronting the system designed to bind people to it, as in the “web” metaphor Strike Debt uses. This demands media activism to affect norms and perhaps laws — fortunately, one of the great successes of the Occupy Movement has been to move anti-capitalism and class inequality into the “sphere of legitimate controversy” from the “sphere of deviance” to use Daniel Hallin’s terms for how the media covers different issues (1986).</p>\n<p>If Strike Debt can succeed where OSDC failed as Gokey aspired with Kick-Stopper, by building a large enough network of debt resisters willing to form a debtor’s union and refuse to pay up, then perhaps we will see a full exit from the debt system and a “salvaging” of popular democracy to quote Ross (2013). At the very least, Strike Debt’s tactics for both media activism and market-based activism add to a creative repertoire for adjusting Lessig’s and Zuckerman’s levers, pioneered by contemporary networked social movements.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Caffentzis, George. 2013. “Reflections on the History of Debt Resistance: The Case of El Barzon.” <em>South Atlantic Quarterly</em> 112 (4): 824–30. doi:10.1215/00382876-2345315.</p>\n<p>Gokey, Thomas. n.d. “A Debt Strike Vision.” <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6J0ITGJReByTHjX9B1UyLOTcyRMHcih-8psAw7G_0g/edit\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6J0ITGJReByTHjX9B1UyLOTcyRMHcih-8psAw7G_0g/edit</a>.</p>\n<p>2011a. “Kick-Stopper,” October 23.

This was the genesis of Strike Debt.\n\n# Building the Movement\n\nStrike Debt’s Facebook page was created June 6, and its website’s domain names were registered on June 11–12. Their first events were “debt assemblies” in parks, starting on June 11, 2012 in Washington Square Park (McKee 2012). The debt assemblies gave a safe space for debtors to come and share their stories of indebtedness and build community and solidarity. They also continued their analysis of the debt system, and started to draft the Debt Resister’s Operations Manual (DROM) to offer advice on how to escape all types of debt and urge individuals to join in collective action, in a debt resistance movement (Ross 2013).\n\nDuring Strike Debt’s first few weeks, a friend recommended to organizer Aaron Smith that he contact Gokey (Larson and Smith 2014). Smith and a former OSDC organizer who had previously spoke to Gokey invited him to travel from Syracuse and pitch his idea for buying debt on the secondary market, like debt collectors do, and then cancelling it (Ibid.). Despite reservations by other Strike Debt organizers who thought the idea was too capitalistic, they pushed ahead with meeting Gokey, hoping the tactic could at least raise awareness (Ibid.).\n\nBy mid-July, the idea of the Rolling Jubilee, then known as the “debt fairy” campaign, was added to Strike Debt’s game plan (McKee 2012). From the beginning, they argued it was not an end-game strategy, as Strike Debt organizer Yates McKee noted in a July 13 essay,\n\n&gt; &gt; “While not a structural solution — and not applicable to student loans — scaled up it could become what David Graeber imagines as a “moving jubilee” capable of both garnering media attention around debtors’ struggles and taking business away from the intermediary companies that profit from hounding and penalizing those unable to pay.” (Ibid.)\n\nGokey had already successfully tested the debt-buying idea using $500 of his own money. To effectively scale the action, Strike Debt reached out to lawyers and accountants for help with the details, and set a goal of raising $50,000 with the hope of buying $1M worth of debt at the going rate of ~5 cents on the dollar (Larson and Smith 2014).\n\nStrike Debt continued to organize debt assemblies over the summer (Ross 2013), building toward OWS’s anniversary on September 17, 2012 (S17), where they would officially launch the DROM. Strike Debt was deeply involved with the planning of and media activism around S17, where one of the “quadrants” was dedicated to the theme of “debt”; they hoped to unite Occupy Movement participants around the issue (Taylor 2012; Graeber 2012; Konczal 2012a).\n\n# The Rolling Jubilee and its Limits\n\nFollowing S17 and the launch of DROM, Strike Debt focused on planning a launch for the Rolling Jubilee to coincide with the November 15, 2012 anniversary of OWS’s eviction from Zuccotti Park. Its Facebook page had already been registered August 14, and its website’s domain names were registered September 26–27. On October 22, they shared a screenshot of the teaser page on their website via Facebook.\n\n![Rolling Jubilee teaser page screenshot shared on Facebook, October 22, 2012](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ER_JZv9UAqSGtHQwofpNhQ.png)\n\nReturning to the successful tactic of story sharing employed by OSDC and the debt assemblies, on October 29, Strike Debt started curating stories arguing for debt resistance on Tumblr. A larger social media bomb via Twitter and blogs was planned to launch the Rolling Jubilee using a mailing list of organizers from the Occupy Movement’s network of encampments — a strategy inspired in part by the Kony2012 campaign’s successful construction and activation of on-the-ground networks to make their video go “viral” (Larson and Smith 2014).\n\nThe launch was designed as a “telethon” entitled “The People’s Bailout,” featuring musicians and comedians taking the stage and a livestream simulcast — all ticket proceeds went to the Rolling Jubilee fund and online donations were tallied with updates punctuating the acts. The social media bomb was planned for a week ahead of time. They created a promotional video and poster for the event, and drafted a press release for their network for promotional use. Unexpected social media success came on November 8 as co-organizer and co-host of the telethon David Rees posted the announcement to his well-followed Tumblr blog the night before the bomb; it piqued the interest of actor and writer Wil Wheaton who re-blogged it, putting the press release in front of his large audience of followers. Within 48 hours, the online donations surpassed the $50,000 goal (Larson and Smith 2014).\n\n![The People’s Bailout, Rolling Jubilee “telethon” Poster](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_TYDZdquyhWWK9b7BHZJtdA.png)\n\nBy the end of its first push, the Rolling Jubilee took in $435,000 (Tepper 2012), well surpassing its goal. However, critics dismissed the Rolling Jubilee as a “gimmick,” arguing it was at a scale too small to have impact and was a distraction from more useful tactics like educating people about strategic bankruptcy (Henwood 2012; Smith 2012). They also questioned its ability to build a movement through debt forgiveness (Konczal 2012b). Strike Debt organizers reiterated that it was never meant to be a large-scale solution (Ross and Ackerman 2012; Ross and Taylor 2012), as McKee had noted early on. Instead, Ross and Taylor’s piece in The Nation emphasized that the Rolling Jubilee was “an act of solidarity and an opportunity for public education,” and introduced the broad set of debt resistance strategies and the long-term vision of a system of positive credit through mutual aid (2012).\n\nThese response articles and interviews also publicized the creation of Strike Debt chapters in cities and on campuses across the country, inspired by the DROM (Ross and Taylor 2012; Tepper 2012). This is Strike Debt’s real end-game strategy: build a networked social movement around debt resistance by correcting the information asymmetry between the lenders and the indebted while promoting a wide variety of actions.\n\nThe Rolling Jubilee stopped collecting donations on December 31, 2013. The donations totaled $701,317. And as of the writing of this case study, they had purchased and “abolished” $14,734,569.87, with one more jubilee announcement on the way. The first four debt purchases, detailed on the “Transparency” page of the Rolling Jubilee website, went to medical debt, the accrual of which is arguably rarely the fault of the debtor, which helps reinforce Strike Debt’s moral argument against the debt system.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWith the Rolling Jubilee ending, the Strike Debt organizers I spoke to in May 2014 say they will miss the massive media attention delivered by the debt buys, but they are eager to focus on creating a more sustainable structure for Strike Debt and building the on-the-ground network of debt resisters (Larson and Smith 2014). They want to grow the number of chapters, especially on college campuses, and get the DROM, which has been expanded into a full book, into more hands. They continue to analyze the debt system and write reports to support their intellectual and moral argument (Graeff and Bhargava 2014). Additionally, they are exploring new forms of action and public education, currently working with an NYU law student to develop “debt clinics” (Ibid.).\n\n# Market-based Activism, Media Activism, or Both?\n\nIn his book Code and other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig contends that there are four ways contemporary society is regulated: law, norms, markets, and architecture (2006). Ethan Zuckerman argues that these also represent opportunities for citizens to affect change in complex systems by treating each of them as levers (2013). Strike Debt as a debt resistance movement and an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street has a particular focus on the market-based lever, generally used to punish corporations by affecting the cost of doing business. The goal of debt resistance as practice by Strike Debt is to undermine and destroy the system of lenders that prey on debtors, ideally drying up their market through non-participation. The Rolling Jubilee is a tactic that tried to subvert the system by using its own market structure to cancel debt. But as the organizers confess, this is symbolic; its utility is its ability to draw attention to the issue, like a creative event in the service of media activism.\n\nAnalyzing Strike Debt’s tactics using Albert Hirschman’s framework of exit, voice, and loyalty, debt resistance looks like an exit from the relationship with big banks and the debt system (1970). This is the long-term goal of an alternative economy for mutual benefit. But this is not easy to achieve because of the laws, norms, markets, and architectures that govern the system and everyone who touches it. Thus, it becomes an exercise in voice, confronting the system designed to bind people to it, as in the “web” metaphor Strike Debt uses. This demands media activism to affect norms and perhaps laws — fortunately, one of the great successes of the Occupy Movement has been to move anti-capitalism and class inequality into the “sphere of legitimate controversy” from the “sphere of deviance” to use Daniel Hallin’s terms for how the media covers different issues (1986).\n\nIf Strike Debt can succeed where OSDC failed as Gokey aspired with Kick-Stopper, by building a large enough network of debt resisters willing to form a debtor’s union and refuse to pay up, then perhaps we will see a full exit from the debt system and a “salvaging” of popular democracy to quote Ross (2013). At the very least, Strike Debt’s tactics for both media activism and market-based activism add to a creative repertoire for adjusting Lessig’s and Zuckerman’s levers, pioneered by contemporary networked social movements.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nCaffentzis, George. 2013. “Reflections on the History of Debt Resistance: The Case of El Barzon.” _South Atlantic Quarterly_ 112 (4): 824–30. doi:10.1215/00382876-2345315.\n\nGokey, Thomas. n.d. “A Debt Strike Vision.” [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6J0ITGJReByTHjX9B1UyLOTcyRMHcih-8psAw7G_0g/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6J0ITGJReByTHjX9B1UyLOTcyRMHcih-8psAw7G_0g/edit).\n\n2011a. “Kick-Stopper,” October 23.

P Prieto-Santos, Iván. M Jorrín-Abellán, and Sara García-Sastre</em></h3>\n<h1 id=\"abstract\">Abstract</h1>\n<p>The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education has the capacity to radically change the nature of education. We live in times of rapid sociocultural changes promoted by the transformative impact of digital technologies. Classified as the world of modern liquid by Zygmunt Bauman, education requires new models to help students to construct a digital identity to survive in stormy waters within contexts of distributed learning and flexible literacies (Edwards, 2002).</p>\n<p>This paper describes a qualitative three-year case study conducted in a Primary rural school where a new collaborative software was introduced alongside other existing classroom technologies, in order to analyze how teachers designed and orchestrated classroom activities in technologically-rich settings. The analysis of teachers designs and the enactments as well of the activities allowed us to identify a set of recurrent elements called “atomic patterns” (Prieto, Villagrá, Jorrín-Abellán &amp; Martínez, 2011) that we have used to improve teachers’ reflection about on their teaching practices. Atomic patterns are small-grained, recurrent elements of teacher practices (extracted from actual practice), using the available classroom elements to further their pedagogical goal, within the restrictions of the (authentic) classroom setting ( assessment needs, curriculum ..). Examples can be seen in the complete catalogue of design and enactment atomic patterns2: “use the digital board to exemplify, “on-the-fly assessment, “disable anonymity on the collaborative tool,”“disallow collaborative tool usage to focus kids’ attention,” etc.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we conducted several Teacher Professional development initiatives such as workshops. This way we pretend to enhance teacher professional competencies to address the challenges for teachers professional development of the 21st century, as well as to contribute in the creation of a community of practice in this educational setting.</p>\n<h1 id=\"weaving-networks-between-schools-and-university-a-three-year-case-study-in-cigales-spain\">Weaving networks between schools and University: a three year case study in Cigales (Spain)</h1>\n<p>In an attempt to understand how teachers orchestrate Technology Enhanced Learning activities in authentic, computer-integrated primary classrooms, a three-year qualitative (2008–2011) intrinsic case study (Stake, 2005) was carried out in the educational setting of a primary school called Ana de Austria, located in a rural area close to Valladolid (Spain).</p>\n<p>The main issue in the initial research effort was to introduce a new Computer Supported Collaborative Learning technology in those classrooms, and observe the way teachers designed, enacted and even improvised with the new tool called Group Scribbles (GS), alongside the other ICT and non-ICT tools in their classrooms. GS is a CSCL tool that was designed in order to allow social coordination of activities, having flexible activity enactment and improvisation in mind. This software is based on well known metaphors such as public and private boards, where ideas are shared, organized and improved, in the form of adhesive stickers (i.e. post-it), where teachers and students can draw and write text, using an ink-based interface.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Thus, co-design workshops were performed with the aim of supporting teachers during the design of ICT activities as well as we had the chance to observe the activities of the K6–8 teachers in their first attempts in the integration of Group Scribbles (GS) in their face-to-face classrooms.</p>\n<p>For this critical and transformative inquiry process data was collected using a variety of qualitative techniques: three semi-structured in depth interviews and one focus group with teachers, as well as 31 participant observations of classroom enactments. In addition screen, audio and video recordings, scripts of teacher’s activities and other documentation such as teacher training school programs etc, were analyzed in order to provide triangulated conclusions supported by enhanced evidence (Prieto, 2012; Villagrá 2012). Figure 1, provides an example of the conceptual structure of “Ana de Austria Case Study.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_fOujCwXweNi1VBuw4IFnBw.png\" alt=\"[Figure 1]: Conceptual structure Ana de Austria Primary School (Spain)\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"understanding-teacher-design-and-enactment-in-technology-enriched-classrooms\">Understanding teacher design and enactment in technology enriched classrooms</h1>\n<p>A sit was expected, the observation of teachers designing with GS showed that teacher scripts tended to describe high-level tasks for the most part, such as large portions of the activity, spanning several minutes and involving teacher decisions and complex interactions between the teacher and the students (Prieto et al, 2010).</p>\n<p>The analysis of the designs allowed us to identify a set of pedagogical recurrent atomic patterns understood as recurrent elements (DeBarger, Penuel, Harris, &amp; Schank, 2011.; Prieto, Villagrá, Jorrín-Abellán, Martínez-Monés &amp; Dimitriadis, 2011), such as those shown in figure 2.</p>\n<p>[Figure 2.] Example atomic pattern cards used in the workshop, both for design-time (left) and enactment-time (right).</p>\n<p>An equivalent set of recurrent elements was encountered when we analyzed the observed activities where these designs were enacted in the classroom. As an example of how the analysis of teacher orchestration was performed, we present here a description and graphical representation in figure 2.1.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_wxDyJXC559FEgOx9eYSKEw.png\" alt=\"[Figure 2.1]: Example atomic pattern cards used in the workshop, both for design-time (left) and enactment-time (right).\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_De0Tp8LtQKL2ZUKBSlRQyg.png\" alt=\"[Figure 2.2] Graphical representation of the enactment analysis of an observed Group Scribbles activity at Ana de Austria School.\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2.1 shows one of the observed activities performed by a K6–7 teacher in a Science class. The activity involved a group of 18 students working in pairs with tablet PCs. Through this activity students were to asked to recognize common objects, professions and buildings that are more present in rural contexts, in contrast with others commonly found in the cities.</p>\n<p>These diagrams distinguish the recurrent elements that were explicitly present in the teacher design (in bold face, e.g clues, marked as 2 in figure 2.1), from those that emerged during the enactment of the activity (in regular typeface). Among these emergent elements we can also identify two kinds: those which are necessary for the teacher to bridge the gap between the higher level design of the activity and the concrete actions in the classroom (e.g. Use whiteboard to illustrate/exemplify, marked as R1a) and those which were not part of the original plan at all, and thus can be considered discipline improvisations (Sawyer, 2010). These improvisations arise from real-time decisions of the teacher in order to face problems (e.g Disallow tool usage, marked as R1c) or take advantage of emergent opportunities.</p>\n<p>Fostering teachers’ reflections using pedagogical routines through Workshops</p>\n<p>As a result of the analysis explained above, we asked ourselves the following question arose:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>How can we use these recurrent routines as particular strategies to promote teachers professional development?</em></p>\n<p>Thus, several workshops were conducted with teachers at Ana de Austria school to illuminate the aforementioned Issue. Nevertheless, for the sake of brevity, they will not be described here. Figure 2.2 provides an illustrative scheme of a prototype example of workshop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A6FSt1Gyb3YgE9ynVOu6Gw.png\" alt=\"[Figure 2.3] Phases of a prototype workshop with teachers carried out in Ana de Austria Primary School\"></p>\n<p>A conceptual idea of pedagogical routines has been in usage in professional development workshops both in primary and higher education settings, as a tool to help teachers in designing and enriching collaborative learning activities with ICT, as well as part of a learning design approach (Prieto, Dimitriadis &amp; Villagrá, 2011). This kind of representations could be specially useful embedded as a “professional language” (Law, Laurillard &amp; Lee, 2011) to help teachers and practitioners in the path of describe and communicate their reflections about designs and their own practice.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this case study provided a good opportunity to explore how we can implement innovations using technology: how can we use data visualization and collection to promote teachers reflection, and how use them for changing and understand teacher practice. In a globalized world, educational policies and educational stakeholders have to provide roadmaps to educational community to exchange meaningful information and share perspectives, in an attempt to identify ways for foster critical citizenship as well as to take advantage of social distributed learning.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Bauman, Zygmunt (2007).

We live in times of rapid sociocultural changes promoted by the transformative impact of digital technologies. Classified as the world of modern liquid by Zygmunt Bauman, education requires new models to help students to construct a digital identity to survive in stormy waters within contexts of distributed learning and flexible literacies (Edwards, 2002).\n\nThis paper describes a qualitative three-year case study conducted in a Primary rural school where a new collaborative software was introduced alongside other existing classroom technologies, in order to analyze how teachers designed and orchestrated classroom activities in technologically-rich settings. The analysis of teachers designs and the enactments as well of the activities allowed us to identify a set of recurrent elements called “atomic patterns” (Prieto, Villagrá, Jorrín-Abellán &amp; Martínez, 2011) that we have used to improve teachers’ reflection about on their teaching practices. Atomic patterns are small-grained, recurrent elements of teacher practices (extracted from actual practice), using the available classroom elements to further their pedagogical goal, within the restrictions of the (authentic) classroom setting ( assessment needs, curriculum ..). Examples can be seen in the complete catalogue of design and enactment atomic patterns2: “use the digital board to exemplify, “on-the-fly assessment, “disable anonymity on the collaborative tool,”“disallow collaborative tool usage to focus kids’ attention,” etc.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted several Teacher Professional development initiatives such as workshops. This way we pretend to enhance teacher professional competencies to address the challenges for teachers professional development of the 21st century, as well as to contribute in the creation of a community of practice in this educational setting.\n\n# Weaving networks between schools and University: a three year case study in Cigales (Spain)\n\nIn an attempt to understand how teachers orchestrate Technology Enhanced Learning activities in authentic, computer-integrated primary classrooms, a three-year qualitative (2008–2011) intrinsic case study (Stake, 2005) was carried out in the educational setting of a primary school called Ana de Austria, located in a rural area close to Valladolid (Spain).\n\nThe main issue in the initial research effort was to introduce a new Computer Supported Collaborative Learning technology in those classrooms, and observe the way teachers designed, enacted and even improvised with the new tool called Group Scribbles (GS), alongside the other ICT and non-ICT tools in their classrooms. GS is a CSCL tool that was designed in order to allow social coordination of activities, having flexible activity enactment and improvisation in mind. This software is based on well known metaphors such as public and private boards, where ideas are shared, organized and improved, in the form of adhesive stickers (i.e. post-it), where teachers and students can draw and write text, using an ink-based interface.\n\n&gt; &gt; Thus, co-design workshops were performed with the aim of supporting teachers during the design of ICT activities as well as we had the chance to observe the activities of the K6–8 teachers in their first attempts in the integration of Group Scribbles (GS) in their face-to-face classrooms.\n\nFor this critical and transformative inquiry process data was collected using a variety of qualitative techniques: three semi-structured in depth interviews and one focus group with teachers, as well as 31 participant observations of classroom enactments. In addition screen, audio and video recordings, scripts of teacher’s activities and other documentation such as teacher training school programs etc, were analyzed in order to provide triangulated conclusions supported by enhanced evidence (Prieto, 2012; Villagrá 2012). Figure 1, provides an example of the conceptual structure of “Ana de Austria Case Study.”\n\n![[Figure 1]: Conceptual structure Ana de Austria Primary School (Spain)](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_fOujCwXweNi1VBuw4IFnBw.png)\n\n# Understanding teacher design and enactment in technology enriched classrooms\n\nA sit was expected, the observation of teachers designing with GS showed that teacher scripts tended to describe high-level tasks for the most part, such as large portions of the activity, spanning several minutes and involving teacher decisions and complex interactions between the teacher and the students (Prieto et al, 2010).\n\nThe analysis of the designs allowed us to identify a set of pedagogical recurrent atomic patterns understood as recurrent elements (DeBarger, Penuel, Harris, &amp; Schank, 2011.; Prieto, Villagrá, Jorrín-Abellán, Martínez-Monés &amp; Dimitriadis, 2011), such as those shown in figure 2.\n\n[Figure 2.] Example atomic pattern cards used in the workshop, both for design-time (left) and enactment-time (right).\n\nAn equivalent set of recurrent elements was encountered when we analyzed the observed activities where these designs were enacted in the classroom. As an example of how the analysis of teacher orchestration was performed, we present here a description and graphical representation in figure 2.1.\n\n![[Figure 2.1]: Example atomic pattern cards used in the workshop, both for design-time (left) and enactment-time (right).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_wxDyJXC559FEgOx9eYSKEw.png)\n\n![[Figure 2.2] Graphical representation of the enactment analysis of an observed Group Scribbles activity at Ana de Austria School.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_De0Tp8LtQKL2ZUKBSlRQyg.png)\n\nFigure 2.1 shows one of the observed activities performed by a K6–7 teacher in a Science class. The activity involved a group of 18 students working in pairs with tablet PCs. Through this activity students were to asked to recognize common objects, professions and buildings that are more present in rural contexts, in contrast with others commonly found in the cities.\n\nThese diagrams distinguish the recurrent elements that were explicitly present in the teacher design (in bold face, e.g clues, marked as 2 in figure 2.1), from those that emerged during the enactment of the activity (in regular typeface). Among these emergent elements we can also identify two kinds: those which are necessary for the teacher to bridge the gap between the higher level design of the activity and the concrete actions in the classroom (e.g. Use whiteboard to illustrate/exemplify, marked as R1a) and those which were not part of the original plan at all, and thus can be considered discipline improvisations (Sawyer, 2010). These improvisations arise from real-time decisions of the teacher in order to face problems (e.g Disallow tool usage, marked as R1c) or take advantage of emergent opportunities.\n\nFostering teachers’ reflections using pedagogical routines through Workshops\n\nAs a result of the analysis explained above, we asked ourselves the following question arose:\n\n&gt; &gt; _How can we use these recurrent routines as particular strategies to promote teachers professional development?_\n\nThus, several workshops were conducted with teachers at Ana de Austria school to illuminate the aforementioned Issue. Nevertheless, for the sake of brevity, they will not be described here. Figure 2.2 provides an illustrative scheme of a prototype example of workshop.\n\n![[Figure 2.3] Phases of a prototype workshop with teachers carried out in Ana de Austria Primary School](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_A6FSt1Gyb3YgE9ynVOu6Gw.png)\n\nA conceptual idea of pedagogical routines has been in usage in professional development workshops both in primary and higher education settings, as a tool to help teachers in designing and enriching collaborative learning activities with ICT, as well as part of a learning design approach (Prieto, Dimitriadis &amp; Villagrá, 2011). This kind of representations could be specially useful embedded as a “professional language” (Law, Laurillard &amp; Lee, 2011) to help teachers and practitioners in the path of describe and communicate their reflections about designs and their own practice.\n\nFurthermore, this case study provided a good opportunity to explore how we can implement innovations using technology: how can we use data visualization and collection to promote teachers reflection, and how use them for changing and understand teacher practice. In a globalized world, educational policies and educational stakeholders have to provide roadmaps to educational community to exchange meaningful information and share perspectives, in an attempt to identify ways for foster critical citizenship as well as to take advantage of social distributed learning.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nBauman, Zygmunt (2007).

Multi-vocality through diverse spokespeople, is thus a substantive and defining quality. It allows for broad enrollment, consensus, alliance, as well as criticism and opposition. INM serves as an example of connective action where the lack of ideological coherence is no longer a barrier to collective action.

By doing so, the case aims to be an example that shows the power of civic media, and how its participatory practices have changed the production and consumption of traditional media.</p>\n<p>As discussed in <em>Convergence Culture</em> (Jenkins 2006), <em>Broadcasting in the 21st Century</em> (Rudin 2011), and “Dimensions of Digital Media Literacy and the Relationship with Social Exclusion” (Park 2012), civic media — founded on the ideals of participation, social justice, and transparency — is being redefined not by larger media companies, but by consumers and amateur, user-generated content, causing a shift in the relationship between broadcaster, listener, and viewer. Where at one time large companies and organizations had been in charge of media outlets, today, through the Internet, almost anyone can become a broadcaster — which is exactly what happened with the case of Karen Klein.</p>\n<p>In June 2012, four 7th grade students from the Greece Athena Middle School in Greece, NY videotaped themselves bullying Klein on their bus ride home. The boys appeared on the film, calling Klein a “bitch” and a “fat ass,” mocking her appearance and age, threatening her, and making her cry. These videos, user-generated content entitled “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93wAqnPQwk.\">Making the Bus Monitor Cry</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74bkNuQv2I8\">Bus Monitor Harassment</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBedTlo7BDs&amp;feature=plcp\">Bus Monitor Harassment 2</a>,” were later posted throughout various social media sites and outlets. While the videos of these boys bullying Klein were originally posted on Facebook, a user who was not one of the bullies reposted the recordings on YouTube. Within a day the videos went viral, demonstrating a perfect example of participatory culture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ImLSmOorMU-XzMBVE3fM3Q.png\" alt=\"Image 1: Screenshot of the video “Making the Bus Monitor Cry” from YouTube.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Cw5SgXImc8eQbFeKB1rY1Q.png\" alt=\"Image 2: Screenshot of the video “Bus Monitor Harassment\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_YWoi_TZJURfChnGkJaOd1A.png\" alt=\"Image 3: Screenshot of the video “Bus Monitor Harassment 2\"></p>\n<p>The digital world and Internet culture is based around this <em>participatory culture</em> (Hobbs 2010; Jenkins 2006; Jenkins et al 2006; Park 2012, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBedTlo7BDs&amp;feature=plcp\">“CapitalTrigga, Bus Monitor Harassment 2” 2012</a>). In “Confronting the Challenges of a Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century,” Jenkins et al. define the term as:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; . . . a culture with relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, and some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices.</p>\n<p>In many ways, participatory culture can be thought of as shifting away from consumer culture. As Jenkins et al. explain, participatory culture requires users to be extremely active in their media use — both in their creation as well as in their consumption.</p>\n<p>In <em>Convergence Culture</em>, Henry Jenkins further makes it clear that media, no matter its own medium or message, cannot exist without participatory culture and a new type of active consumer. In her* book Digital and Media Literacy: A Plan of Action*, Renee Hobbs explains that to be a part of participatory culture, it is absolutely necessary to incorporate both creating as well as sharing. People are not just consumers, but also producers and contributors by broadcasting different types of media online. Additionally, there is no longer a clear distinction between producer and user, broadcaster and viewer.</p>\n<p>The boys who filmed themselves taunting Klein, however, are not the focal point of participatory culture within this example. It’s the audience who watched the videos (“the active consumers”) that make the event so key.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; After all, an important aspect of participatory culture is that the audiences cannot simply remain spectators, solely consuming information presented to them; rather, audiences themselves need to create their own content and interact with others doing the same.</p>\n<p>The online reaction to the videos of Klein being bullied was tremendous. Audiences posted response videos on YouTube and there were multiple discussion threads about the incident on Reddit (<a href=\"http://redd.it/vb5gj\">“jelloleaf, Kids call bus monitor ‘fat’” 2012</a>, “<a href=\"http://redd.it/vbfxq\">razorsheldon, CALL TO ARMS” 2012</a>)— a participatory site that (based on points and voting) shares web content such as text posts, videos, and other links. The more points (and community approval and awareness) a post gets, the more likely the content will reach the front page, where the most users will see it. These Reddit users were incredibly active consumers, and their sharing of the videos was essential.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_VioQhFgJMOSM48yZW-bXkA.png\" alt=\"Image 4: Screenshot of one of the Reddit threads discussing the Karen Klein videos\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_6suyPCHw5NSRT5yooU_lDg.png\" alt=\"Image 5: Screenshot of a second Reddit thread discussing the Karen Klein videos\"></p>\n<p>After much discussion, Reddit users began looking for further information, finding the name and location of the school, Karen Klein’s Facebook profile, and the names, Facebook pages, and phone numbers of her tormentors. After much of the personal information was posted, Reddit moderators stepped in, shutting down the thread for privacy violations. Moving the discussion to another site, the videos were also shared on 4chan — an image-based bulletin board community where users can post comments and share images. (The discussion surrounding Karen Klein, however, no longer exists, as 4chan has no archive and threads expire). 4chan users reposted the information that had been shared on Reddit, again sharing the same information that had previously been posted on Reddit; but this time also including their home addresses. The users had found out Klein’s tormentor’s information, and now they wanted to find a way hold them accountable.</p>\n<p>The users on Reddit and 4chan are perfect examples of produsers. In <em>Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life and Beyond: From Production to Produsage</em>, Axel Bruns defines produsers as people who can be both users and producers (2008). In the case with Karen Klein, Reddit and 4Chan users were both consuming the video her bullies posted, as well as producing discussion that caused the video to go viral. Bruns further describes how produsers are interacting with content production through produsage, which is “the collaborative and continuous building and extending of existing content in pursuit of further improvement” (ibid, 21) Put simply, the users on Reddit were participating in a form of produsage, “extending” the existing videos by attempting to improve Klein’s life situation by raising awareness and making a change within an offline space.</p>\n<p>As Bruns further writes, it is about “transferring knowledge” and turning internet consumption and information from a static practice into a shared space where users participate and share with each other (ibid, 208). People began calling the Greece school system and the student’s homes, demanding action. 4chan users posted that Klein only stayed at her job because it was the only work she could find, and she could not afford to quit. One Reddit user, Max Sidorov, started a fundraiser on Indiegogo (a crowdfunding website) with the original intention to raise money for Klein to go on a vacation (<a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lets-give-karen-the-bus-monitor-h-klein-a-vacation--6\">Sidorov 2012</a>). The users Reddit and 4chan users further participated in produasage, when they built awareness of her situation and helped raise money through the Indiegogo campaign and researching to find out the perpetrators in this incident, and see to it that they faced consequences for their actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_45d9KTPukyTQcowdF8IEhA.png\" alt=\"Image 6: A screenshot of the Indiegogo page started to raise money for Karen Klein by Max Sidorov.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_BnjDFG2JXZkB9-FoRFYmYg.png\" alt=\"Image 7: A screenshot of the Karen Klein Foundation website.\"></p>\n<p>After the video went viral, being broadcasted on both social media sites and in traditional news and print, the campaign raised over $700,000. Klein later used a portion of the money to start an anti-bullying organization: The Karen Klein Foundation. Additionally, the students in question were suspended from school for a year, required to complete 50 hours of community service with senior citizens, and had to attend a formal program in bullying prevention.</p>\n<p>Along with online, collaborative environments of participatory culture, produsers (much like the Reddit and 4chan users) are completely changing and blurring how media is made, distributed, and consumed, causing a shift within the traditional top-down media and release of content. It was not until after the story went viral through social media sites that the mainstream media discovered and reported the story in magazines, newspapers, television, and radio. It is important to note that top-down media did not drive this news story; this became a story for traditional broadcasters after it was discovered, discussed, and driven to a viral status due to civic media, participatory culture, and produsage.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Bruns, Axel. 2008. <em>Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life and Beyond: From Production to Produsage</em>.

Empathy, though simply defined as one’s ability to comprehend the situation of another, is a complex process of the mind and heart (Gerdes 2011; Davis 1980). Findings connect it to a myriad of pro-social outcomes such as helping behavior (Graziano, Habashi and Sheese 2007), cooperating skills, self-esteem, and civic engagement (Noddings 2002). It also has inverse associations with bullying, racism, depression, and aggression (Legault, Gutsell and Inzlict 2011).

Researchers agree that empathy occurs both intellectually and emotively (Davis 1980; Preston and DeWaal 2002). This dual-process function combines a neurological reflex (mirror neurons) (Gutsell and Inzlicht 2010), and learned skill (Spiro 1992). Though some people are born with empathic predispositions, empathy can be fostered intellectually and emotionally (Mehrabian, Young, and Sato 1998). The tool often used to measure empathy levels is the <em>Interpersonal Reactivity Index</em> (IRI) (Davis 1983). The IRI is based on four subscales, two that are cognitive (c) and two emotional (e); imagination (c), perspective taking (c), affective connection (e), and personal distress (e). These subscales offer the theoretical framework from which to examine the case of Invisible Children and <em>Kony 2012</em>. Through the use of technology, social media, and film, this organization inadvertently put millennials in an empathic pipeline that aligns with these subscales.</p>\n<p>For most, <em>Kony 2012</em> was the first experience with Invisible Children, though the decade-old organization has made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/invisiblechildreninc\">hundreds of podcasts and films</a>. The story structure of their film is simple: a westerner is introduced on-screen; the viewer would affectively connect to him/her. he westerner would make a connection with a war-affected peer in northern Uganda, and the audience would be gently guided into that connection as well. This method of reporting and storytelling is not unique, especially for those telling the stories of people in distant places. In a youtube question and answer session, <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/youtube-question-on-africa-coverage/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Nicholas Kristof discusses</a> a “white arc” that he uses to emotionally scaffold his readership into a connection to a far off humanitarian crisis (Kristof, Youtube Question on Africa Coverage 2010). Normally, distance is a barrier to empathic connection (Ginzburg 1994), so Invisible Children’s the use of visuals and Kristof’s “arc” help overcome that geographical barrier. Next, the open sourcing of podcasts, webinars, school assembly and <a href=\"http://invisiblechildren.com/program/national-tour/\">classroom screenings</a> offered a multi-sensory entry point, which was both engaging and easy to virtually share. This method of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF2s8q7WW8o\">story telling helps forge an empathic connection</a> with a world issue that many are overwhelmed by. In this way an “affective connection” is formed, marking the first step in a viewers’ empathic engagement.</p>\n<p>Invisible Children capitalizes on audiences’ emotional investment to impart the context and the scale of the issue. The affective connection creates a motivational effect so statistics that might otherwise be boring are now interesting (Kristof, New York Times Op Ed 2007). The use of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3GbB32bIuQ\">animation sequencing</a>, re-enactments, and real-time footage, Invisible Children kept engagement high and compelling, helping viewers through the “perspective-taking” phase of empathy. After that, the films’ story arc reaches a climax — the viewer is guided toward a feeling of “personal distress.” Upon feeling the affective connection to a victim in crisis, gaining an understanding of context and scale (“perspective taking”), audiences begin to sense an urgency of the situation in real time. At this point viewers are still only partially through an empathy building process. Viewer empowerment is the next necessary step in that process, and required to set viewers up to engage in “helping behavior” outcomes. At this point of experiencing “personal distress,” one’s brain seeks relief in one of two ways: constructive action, or avoidance/redirection. Avoidance often looks like “compassion fatigue” and burn out (Batson, Fultz and Schoenrade 1987).</p>\n<p>It is here that Invisible Children’s strategy is to first cast a vision to end the crisis, and then to invite the viewer toward constructive engagement (relieving personal distress). The empowerment message was made even more effective through the medium of film because a movie literally offers a vision of what can be, igniting the “imagination” aspect of empathy (Davis 1983). Audiences, therefore, are carefully guided through the four clinical requirements of empathy in an artful and pedagogically sound way. <em>Kony 2012</em>mirrored this empathic journey, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEKr1mjII-c&amp;list=PLECBCC7E6850CCEEB&amp;index=3\">viewers of the film responded</a> just as empathy research would suggest, by participating in helping behaviors (Preston and DeWaal 2002). Though controversial, this 30-minute film about a remote war was the most shared video in history. It broke expectations of millennials’ apathetic nature, and gave insight on how to tap into the empathy and desirable pro-social behaviors of this generation.</p>\n<p>This is the empathic pipeline is represented throughout Invisible Children’s overall brand engagement strategy.

Empathy, though simply defined as one’s ability to comprehend the situation of another, is a complex process of the mind and heart (Gerdes 2011; Davis 1980). Findings connect it to a myriad of pro-social outcomes such as helping behavior (Graziano, Habashi and Sheese 2007), cooperating skills, self-esteem, and civic engagement (Noddings 2002). It also has inverse associations with bullying, racism, depression, and aggression (Legault, Gutsell and Inzlict 2011).

Rallying around the slogan “A Gigante Accordou” [“The Giant Has Awakened”], these protests were the largest displays of citizens taking the street since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s (Venicio 2013, 65–69). Though the demonstrators raised multiple grievances including reckless public spending on mega-events like the Olympics and the World Cup, entrenched governmental corruption, and the arbitrary raising of public transportation fares, one of the most common claims was an intense dissatisfaction with the way the nation’s news media were failing to represent the views of the Brazilian citizenry. When observing this situation, international commentators from media outlets from The Wall Street Journal to The Guardian observed that the protests were throwing into clear relief a dissatisfaction over oligopoly control of mainstream media and its impact on information access and news production. In turn, the protests offered what many international journalists called the “beginning of an alternative media sphere in Brazil”(Loretta 2013).</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; At the center of the shifting media landscape was a social-media based citizen journalism project calling itself “MídiaNINJA.”</p>\n<p>Launched in late 2012, NINJA (a Portuguese acronym for “Independent Narratives, Journalism, and Action) has received copious attention for using footage recorded on mobile phones and aired via social media to record police violence and unsanctioned arrests during the 2013 protests.

On the technological level, NINJA draws heavily on both the recording functions of smart phones and the distributional capabilities of social networking sites including TwitCasting, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The process begins when the group’s reporters (or “NINJAs” as they call them) record street-level footage of demonstrations or public events. This material is then uploaded directly onto the group’s TwitCasting site. (The TwitCasting service was developed by the Japanese Moi Corporation in early 2013 as a way for using Twitter feeds to stream content from smart phones directly onto a “channel” developed and maintained by individual users). From here it is re-screened in chunks on the group’s websites, called “Pos-TV” (or “Post-TV”). Videos from the group’s sites are then re-posted on NINJA’s Facebook page and Twitter account.

From a financial perspective, NINJA faces a difficult and potentially paradoxical situation. While the group largely consists of unpaid volunteers, NINJA does have a board of directors consisting exclusively of FDE members. This board is responsible for maintaining equipment, covering traveling costs for trainings, paying for data storage, and providing legal fees accrued by arrested NINJAs. Though critics don’t dispute the idea that a project like NINJA with expansive aspirations needs a sizable operational budget, they have expressed concern about both the source of the group’s financial resources and how finances are distributed (Yúdice 2012). In 2012 FDE founder Pablo Capilé faced a wave of public scrutiny when it became public that the group had received a substantial amount of money from Coca Cola to sponsor its annual “Marcha da Liberdade”(“Liberty March”) (Forresteri 2013). FDE’s fundraising strategies became subject to even more intense scrutiny when numerous rumors began to circulate claiming that the group received large financial contributions from political parties on the right and left. NINJA’s financial situation became even more contested when opponents started to accuse group leadership of being highly secretive about NINJA’s budget. Along with these financial considerations, NINJA’s commitment to non-partisan, nationwide coverage has in some cases led to a drop in membership as collaborators have stopped contributing in order to start their own TwitCasting channels including MídiaCAPOEIRA in Salvador, MídiaGEISHA in São Paulo, and Colletivo Carranca in Rio. Former collaborators have also left to work with groups that are more directly aligned with political or social movements such as the increasingly popular Black Bloc anarchist movement. According to NINJA co-coordinator Felipe Altenfelder, the rise of these new groups has pushed NINJA to a point where it has to re-consider it’s role as an autonomous media producer (Belém 2014).</p>\n<p>As a case, NINJA offers novel strategies for encouraging participation in media production and using citizen journalism to protect the right to openly gather and protest in public spaces. However, it also highlights fundamental obstacles citizen journalism projects face related to fundraising and preserving volunteer interest.

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaefc1172290686e460d8d"},"enabled":true,"title":"The 2013 Gezi Park Protest and #resistgezi\n","body":{"html":"<p>Dr. Ulas Basar Gezgin (Associate Professor, Turkey)</p>\n<p>The Gezi Park Protest in Istanbul was the most massive of its kind in the modern Turkish history. Although it was hailed as a ‘social media revolution’ by techno-centric researchers and techno-optimists, the roots of resistance can be traced to pre-social-media era whereby people still had reasons to go out and protest.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, social media, especially Twitter served an informational function where TV channels were suppressed, as evidenced by the recent Twitter ban.</p>\n<p>The major hashtags were #direngezi, which acted as a citizen journalism tool, and its English version #resistgezi, which targeted international audiences. The hashtag #resistgezi worths study for its sporadic, unpredictable character. While it was a translation of the Turkish #direngezi, it did not merely serve the audience as the translation of tweets in Turkish per se. This work analyzes the tweets with the hashtag #resistgezi.</p>\n<p>The first #resistgezi tweet which is on June 1 refers to a letter published on CNN.1 The next set of tweets by a single user shares updates and pics from the protest scenes in Turkish and English. The day ends by a protest pic from Köln in support of police attacks in Istanbul as a response to Gezi Protests. In a few tweets on June 2, the content gets diversified with the posting of an Anonymous video on Youtube in support of Gezi protestors and reporting from sites other than Istanbul. This day is also marked by a Brazilian netizen tweeting for Gezi and video share portraying a 76 year-old woman supporting the protestors. The first “Everyday I’m chapuling!!!” expression appeared on June 5, and the next day witnessed the first tweet in a language other than Turkish and English. By June 7, the first tweet on protests at Izmir — the third largest city in Turkey — appeared, as did the first documentary on Gezi protests. June 8 was the day for the first tweet in German and first one about the Canadian protests for support. On June 9, only half of the tweets were in English. This was a relatively peaceful period as the police had retreated, leaving Gezi Park to the protestors to set their free zone. However, the police attack on June 11, which reflected as a spark in the number of tweets. On the other hand, it is noteworthy to see that almost all those tweets were secondhand accounts from the international newspapers rather than acts of citizen and mobile journalism on this day and the next day. The forced evacuation day (June 15) was one of the peaks of #resistgezi. It’s unusual to see that only one of the tweets on this bloody day aimed to draw attention of the international media (@CNN @BBCWorld @CTV_Television). The next day mostly involved the portrayal of the protest sites, while another tweet in Spanish appeared — although it was about the official demonstration against the Gezi protestors from a critical point of view. June 17 saw the first Italian tweet as well as the inauguration of a new user account: @Resist_Gezi. This account, although almost never used #resistgezi hashtag, has had more than 3,000 tweets with nearly a thousand followers. On June 18, an Argentinean user showed his/her support during the first day of the ‘stand still man’ protests. On the same day, new hashtags (#duranadam (stand still man), #kirmizilikadin (the woman in red), #siyahlikadin (the woman in black) appeared as the symbols of the Gezi Resistance. On June 23, 2 tweets that bridge the resistance in Turkey and Brazil were seen as well as the first #resistgezi tweet in French.</p>\n<p>July turned out to be a cold month for #resistgezi tweets, however July 5 could be noted as the day on which the first tweet in Dutch appeared, and a number German tweets were posted. A tragic development of this month was the murder of a 19 year-old protestor (Ali Ismail Korkmaz) by police, something that reflected in #resistgezi tweets. As the protests were on low, the tweets of this month mostly involved share of relevant websites, readings, or videos of the past months. The only remarkable tweet about the protests was the one depicting Vienna protests for international solidarity.</p>\n<p>In the next month, August 3 was the peaking day due to a single user (@echonia) that successfully reported the protests from Taksim with pics and tweets in English only. For all 3 months, the intended audience of the tweets remained largely unclear. However, a tweet on August 13 directly addressed Brazil and South Korea; it read: “Stop selling tear gas to Turkey. Government [sic] using extreme violence.”</p>\n<p>September was the beginning of a dead month by tweets that criticized Istanbul’s 2020 Olympics bid. BICDA (the Solidarity Network for Information and Communication Workers) briefly enters the Twitter screen, although they could be expected to tweet more about Gezi. Just like September, the months until May 2014 saw no action. The tweets during those months were rare, but consistent in terms of content: mostly about international protests (e.g. Barcelona, New York metro etc.), with images and motives from Gezi. The Amnesty International report was posted, while the first #resistgezi tweet in Swedish appeared. A tweet referred to the METU (Middle East Technical University) protests, while another tapped the problematic Republican Day celebrations. At the end of the year, the protests moved to another direction as the recordings of corruption were released, and this was reflected in #resistgezi tweets. The final #resistgezi tweet is a picture from May Day clashes in Turkey.</p>\n<p>This presentation shows that #resistgezi tweets, mainly, did not serve the function of drawing attention of the international media or building up a pro-Gezi international public opinion. It was neither an exclusive set of protest reporting nor international campaigning. Although it is clear that tweets helped the protestors to organize by Turkish hashtags, the international tweets did not even reach the audience. This can be comparable with #occupygezi which is very active and comprehensive, capitalizing on the worldwide occupy movements which are organized as a configuration of global networks.</p>\n<p>For More Media:</p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174428\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146559_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118172382\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505142611_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174422\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505150543_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174424\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505150150_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174426\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146980_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174427\"><img src=\"http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146546_640.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a></p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

Although it was hailed as a ‘social media revolution’ by techno-centric researchers and techno-optimists, the roots of resistance can be traced to pre-social-media era whereby people still had reasons to go out and protest.\n\n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, social media, especially Twitter served an informational function where TV channels were suppressed, as evidenced by the recent Twitter ban.\n\nThe major hashtags were #direngezi, which acted as a citizen journalism tool, and its English version #resistgezi, which targeted international audiences. The hashtag #resistgezi worths study for its sporadic, unpredictable character. While it was a translation of the Turkish #direngezi, it did not merely serve the audience as the translation of tweets in Turkish per se. This work analyzes the tweets with the hashtag #resistgezi.\n\nThe first #resistgezi tweet which is on June 1 refers to a letter published on CNN.1 The next set of tweets by a single user shares updates and pics from the protest scenes in Turkish and English. The day ends by a protest pic from Köln in support of police attacks in Istanbul as a response to Gezi Protests. In a few tweets on June 2, the content gets diversified with the posting of an Anonymous video on Youtube in support of Gezi protestors and reporting from sites other than Istanbul. This day is also marked by a Brazilian netizen tweeting for Gezi and video share portraying a 76 year-old woman supporting the protestors. The first “Everyday I’m chapuling!!!” expression appeared on June 5, and the next day witnessed the first tweet in a language other than Turkish and English. By June 7, the first tweet on protests at Izmir — the third largest city in Turkey — appeared, as did the first documentary on Gezi protests. June 8 was the day for the first tweet in German and first one about the Canadian protests for support. On June 9, only half of the tweets were in English. This was a relatively peaceful period as the police had retreated, leaving Gezi Park to the protestors to set their free zone. However, the police attack on June 11, which reflected as a spark in the number of tweets. On the other hand, it is noteworthy to see that almost all those tweets were secondhand accounts from the international newspapers rather than acts of citizen and mobile journalism on this day and the next day. The forced evacuation day (June 15) was one of the peaks of #resistgezi. It’s unusual to see that only one of the tweets on this bloody day aimed to draw attention of the international media (@CNN @BBCWorld @CTV_Television). The next day mostly involved the portrayal of the protest sites, while another tweet in Spanish appeared — although it was about the official demonstration against the Gezi protestors from a critical point of view. June 17 saw the first Italian tweet as well as the inauguration of a new user account: @Resist_Gezi. This account, although almost never used #resistgezi hashtag, has had more than 3,000 tweets with nearly a thousand followers. On June 18, an Argentinean user showed his/her support during the first day of the ‘stand still man’ protests. On the same day, new hashtags (#duranadam (stand still man), #kirmizilikadin (the woman in red), #siyahlikadin (the woman in black) appeared as the symbols of the Gezi Resistance. On June 23, 2 tweets that bridge the resistance in Turkey and Brazil were seen as well as the first #resistgezi tweet in French.\n\nJuly turned out to be a cold month for #resistgezi tweets, however July 5 could be noted as the day on which the first tweet in Dutch appeared, and a number German tweets were posted. A tragic development of this month was the murder of a 19 year-old protestor (Ali Ismail Korkmaz) by police, something that reflected in #resistgezi tweets. As the protests were on low, the tweets of this month mostly involved share of relevant websites, readings, or videos of the past months. The only remarkable tweet about the protests was the one depicting Vienna protests for international solidarity.\n\nIn the next month, August 3 was the peaking day due to a single user (@echonia) that successfully reported the protests from Taksim with pics and tweets in English only. For all 3 months, the intended audience of the tweets remained largely unclear. However, a tweet on August 13 directly addressed Brazil and South Korea; it read: “Stop selling tear gas to Turkey. Government [sic] using extreme violence.”\n\nSeptember was the beginning of a dead month by tweets that criticized Istanbul’s 2020 Olympics bid. BICDA (the Solidarity Network for Information and Communication Workers) briefly enters the Twitter screen, although they could be expected to tweet more about Gezi. Just like September, the months until May 2014 saw no action. The tweets during those months were rare, but consistent in terms of content: mostly about international protests (e.g. Barcelona, New York metro etc.), with images and motives from Gezi. The Amnesty International report was posted, while the first #resistgezi tweet in Swedish appeared. A tweet referred to the METU (Middle East Technical University) protests, while another tapped the problematic Republican Day celebrations. At the end of the year, the protests moved to another direction as the recordings of corruption were released, and this was reflected in #resistgezi tweets. The final #resistgezi tweet is a picture from May Day clashes in Turkey.\n\nThis presentation shows that #resistgezi tweets, mainly, did not serve the function of drawing attention of the international media or building up a pro-Gezi international public opinion. It was neither an exclusive set of protest reporting nor international campaigning. Although it is clear that tweets helped the protestors to organize by Turkish hashtags, the international tweets did not even reach the audience. This can be comparable with #occupygezi which is very active and comprehensive, capitalizing on the worldwide occupy movements which are organized as a configuration of global networks.\n\nFor More Media:\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146559_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174428)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505142611_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118172382)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505150543_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174422)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505150150_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174424)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146980_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174426)\n\n**vimeo**:\n[![vimeo](http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505146546_640.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/118174427)\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

Before these two mandates of the PAN government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) ruled the country for seven decades, and in the 2012 elections the PRI was credited by polls as the favorite party, with Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) leading the coalition “Commitment for Mexico.” The other contenders were Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who led a coalition of the left parties, while Josefina Vazquez Mota and Gabriel Quadri were the candidates of the PAN and the PANAL parties, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Friday, May 11, 2012, EPN arrived at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City to give a conference. During the candidate’s presentation, students began to question him with posters; the questions raised were regarding the police repression in Atenco that occurred in 2006 when EPN was governor of the state of Mexico. When EPN justified Atenco’s violent repression, tension rose and he had to leave the university surrounded by a security cordon. The triggers that led students to organize the movement were the subsequent statements released by some PRI politicians who qualified students as thugs, violent, fascist, and intolerant — going so far as to deny their affiliation with the university. Mexican television networks and the newspaper chain Organización Editorial Mexicana presented versions of the event where EPN was portrayed as a hero against a boycott organized by the left.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ime5rEUABOK-8Ae4ghrAng.png\" alt=\"The 12 May 2012 cover of the Mexican newspaper El Sol de México (The Sun of Mexico) of the Organización Editorial Mexicana (Mexican Editorial Organization) reads “Success of Peña, despite orchestrated attempt of boycott.”\"></p>\n<p>Facing manipulative media coverage, 131 university students published a video on YouTube:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7XbocXsFkI\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/P7XbocXsFkI/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Youtube\"></a>\n<em>131 Alumnos de la Ibero responden / YouTube</em></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; in which they exhibited their teaching credentials of the Universidad Iberoamericana, and read their names to criticize the politicians who had accused them of being violent and not affiliated with the university.

The phrase “131 Students from Ibero” quickly became one of the <a href=\"http://capitalsocialmexico.com/2012/05/15/mas-sobre-la-viralizacion-del-tt-sobre-la-ibero-que-dio-la-vuelta-al-mundo/\">trending topics on Twitter in Mexico and worldwide</a>.

Televisa, the most powerful media corporation in the country, is considered the central agent within what has been defined as the Mexican telecracy — i.e. the imposition of the interests of the advertising dealers of the TV monopolies over the interests of the whole Mexican society and public interest (Esteinou and Alva de la Selva, 2011). As Villamil has shown, the PRI party and Televisa carefully constructed the image of EPN over six years (Villamil 2010).

When the Gezi protests erupted, 140journos began re-tweeting messages sent in by protestors nationwide.</p>\n<p>Indeed, 140journos’ tweets increased from 401 in May 2013 to 2,218 in June, and the number of its followers from 8,000 to 45,000.

The OP was originally launched in late 2012 as a Facebook page under a different name to express solidarity with Kurdish political prisoners. At one point it was shut down by the Facebook administration for having allegedly published pornographic content. The page later re-opened under its current name and now serves as a hub for user-generated content on sensitive social and political issues. During and in the aftermath of Gezi protests, the OP’s Facebook page was closed twice, and had to re-open under a different name on each occasion (<a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/facebook-facing-accusations-of-censoring-citizen-journalism.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=51996&amp;NewsCatID=374\">Guler 2013</a>). Responding to accusations of censorship, the Director of Facebook Policy in Europe claimed the pages shut down not because of their pro-Kurdish opinion but because they posted content praising the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S and the E.U. (<a href=\"http://www.radikal.com.tr/yazarlar/ezgi_basaran/pkkya_ait_her_sey_kapatma_nedenidir-1148259\">Basaran 2013</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nTb9F2ZQn91uPnZR3f537Q.png\" alt=\"Facebook page of Otekilerin Postasi\"></p>\n<p>After the Gezi protests waned, the affordances of social media were evident once again during the local elections of March 2014. In the period leading up to the elections, a number of civic initiatives emerged to increase voter turnout, monitor polling stations and prevent electoral fraud. They were mainly driven by the AKP’s increasing authoritarianism in the post-Gezi period and by widespread rumors about the party’s attempts to rig the elections. Among these initiatives 140journos and Oy ve Otesi (“Vote and Beyond”) particularly stood out. Oy ve Otesi was launched by eight volunteers to recruit, train and organize election monitors in Istanbul. Reaching out to the public via Twitter and Facebook, the initiative managed to enlist close to 30,000 volunteers who monitored 95% of polling stations in Istanbul on Election Day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_qvPBwrMeA4XVvh9R5XMS-g.png\" alt=\"Facebook page of Oy ve Otesi announcing preparations for the presidential election\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; The other prominent actor in the coordination of monitoring and verification of ballot box tabulations was 140journos.</p>\n<p>On Election Day, 140journos urged citizens to send photographs of ballot box tabulations under the hashtag #tutanak. The team of volunteers aggregated nearly 6,000 received photos and compared them to official results published by the Election Board, and reported 250 irregularities (<a href=\"https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/journos-mobile-platform-verifies-social-media-content-filters-citizen-reporting-and-extends-the-coverage-of-civic-news\">Baykurt 2014</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_sJ_lnAGTsX5HsQyGz4TfQQ.png\" alt=\"Using hashtags #tutanakNO and #tutanak, citizens announced which ballot box tabulations had been missing\"></p>\n<p>140journos also developed a new web-based application to detect and report tabulation irregularities. Named Saydirac (“The Counter”), the application aims to enable citizens to enter data into the system which will then be compared to official results. 140journos launched Saydirac on June 1, 2014 when repeat elections were held in three provinces. One of 140journos’ co-founders, Cem Aydogdu notes that they hope Saydirac will facilitate active participation of citizens: “This is a tool designed to prevent a handful of individuals from shouldering the burden, a tool to prevent citizens from remaining on the sidelines and instead take responsibility for their own votes.”</p>\n<p>140journos used Saydirac again on August 10, 2014 — the day of the presidential election. It was joined by other initiatives that also organized volunteers and used social media to monitor and verify the votes. Among them were @Oy ve Otesi (Vote and Beyond), @SandikBasindayiz (We are at the Polls) and @TRnin Oylari (Turkey’s Votes) and its local branches in six major cities. Before the election, these groups organized close to 10,000 volunteers to work as “ballot box monitors,” posted YouTube training videos for them, and even set up 1–800 numbers in case they needed assistance. The presidential election was not as heated as the local elections back in March due to several reasons, most prominently because of low voter turnout. Accordingly, social media activity levels remained low compared to March elections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_IANpgH132oF17zXstxrJpQ.png\" alt=\"@TRnin Oylari (Turkey’s Votes) had prepared this guideline for volunteers on how to report voting, tallying and other irregularities\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_PG6bkqODE51ZPUR-UzCSxg.png\" alt=\"The core of group of volunteers of Ankaranin Oylari (Ankara’s Votes) on the day of the Presidential election\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"discussion\">Discussion</h1>\n<p>The literature on the role of the Internet and digital communications regarding democratization, and social, political and economic change has generally centered on a dichotomy between cyber-utopians and skeptics. Whereas the utopian view holds that the Internet enables the emergence of a citizen-based, participatory democracy (Negroponte 1995, Dyson 1997, Shirky 2011), skeptics focus on the issues that emanate from corporate colonization, data mining, surveillance, digital divides, and nation-state censorship laws, and question the impact of connectivity on social movements and change (McChesney 2000, Margolis and Resnick 2000, Coleman and Blumler 2009, Morozov 2011). This split between the cyber-utopians and skeptics has deepened further in the aftermath of the protests in Iran in 2009 and the Arab uprisings in 2011 as the former group declared the Internet and social media “tools of change” that could defy authoritarian regimes (Diamond 2010, Stepanova 2011, Allagui and Keubler 2011, Sullivan 2009, “The Iranian Uprisings” 2013) while the latter interrogated the import of digital tools and instead emphasized the social, cultural, and political roots of the protests and the human agency behind them (Sreberny and Khiabany 2010, Deibert and Rohozinski 2011, Morozov 2011, Christensen 2011, Newsom, Lengel and Cassar 2011). This “conceptual gridlock” or “false dichotomy” between optimist and pessimist perspectives has inevitably led to the discussion of digital activism simply in terms of its effectiveness while ignoring other questions (Aouragh and Alexander 2014, Echchaibi 2013). To remedy this limited framework, researchers began to consider the Internet and forms of digital activism not merely as tools but rather as spaces and paid attention to the co-existence and co-evolution of technologies, practices and actors or the convergence of online and offline activism, for example (Khamis and Vaughn 2011, Trere 2012, Castells 2012, Aouragh and Alexander 2014, Echchaibi 2013).</p>\n<p>To make sense of the aforementioned civic initiatives in Turkey, I adopt a similar line of thinking, and focus on their creative and insurgent capacities instead of evaluating their potential to dismantle the existing power structures. Here I draw upon Echchaibi’s argument that forms of digital activism, even in the absence of revolution, are significant because they create spaces of dissent. They show how “people confront power” through “a series of creative improvisations and flows, which may or may not lead to structural change” (2013, 865). It is this “act of doing” that is significant and deserves attention, not the end result (the defiance of the regime, the dismantling of the status quo, etc). Therefore the emphasis should be on the “sustained and disciplined online presence” of digital practices not their potential to subvert the system. In a similar vein, Aouragh and Alexander focus on the import of “spheres of dissidence” and discuss the Internet as a “space” of political activity rather than a tool. In light of these explorations, I consider the digitally-enabled initiatives in Turkey as noteworthy expressions of dissent, participation and civic engagement especially when one considers the broader media and political systems in which they operate.</p>\n<p>Similar to other national contexts such as Iran, Russia, China to mention just a few, state control of the Internet looms large in Turkey. With the steady increase in the Internet use since the mid-2000s, the state’s efforts to confine the networked public sphere have amplified as seen in the filtering and blocking of online content, the construction of a strict legal framework, and more recently the demonization and banning of social media platforms (e.g. Twitter and YouTube bans of March 2014). So far, 140journos, Oy ve Otesi and others have not been faced with any blocking attempts or overt obstruction from the state (The Facebook pages of Otekilerin Postasi were closed numerous times, but one must remember that it was not upon the request of the Turkish government but by the company administration’s own initiative). The absence of state intervention can be attributed to a couple of factors: The ruling AKP party has cemented its hold over power to the extent that it does not deem these initiatives threatening at all. Or it is using them as “safety valves” so anti-government activists can express their frustration online or via these initiatives instead of organizing mass protests. It is also likely that the government is exploiting the presence of these initiatives so it can claim that there is freedom of speech in Turkey and ward off criticism.</p>\n<p>It must also be noted that 140journos, Oy ve Otesi, Saydirac and TRnin Oylari bespeak the convergence of online and offline activism as well as the evolving relationships between traditional mass media and the Internet. For example, 140journos relies on its network of volunteers who post words and images from the street, while Oy ve Otesi, Saydirac and TRnin Oylari foster and build upon the physical presence of individuals at polling stations. Also, the input of these initiatives, be it the dissemination of news or the reporting of voting irregularities, are generally picked up by newspapers, television channels and online news sites. Therefore, it is important to analyze these initiatives not merely in terms of the Internet and digital connectivity, but within the framework of the larger media ecosystem, spatiality and mediation (McCurdy 2011, Castells 2012, Costanza-Chock 2012, Gebaudo 2012).</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Allagui, Ilhem and Johanne Keubler. 2011. “The Arab Spring and the Role of ICTs.” <em>International Journal of Communication</em> 5: 1435–1442.</p>\n<p>Aouragh, Miriam and Anne Alexander. 2014. “Egypt’s Unfinished Revolution: The Role of the Media Revisited.” <em>International Journal of Communication</em> 8: 890–915.</p>\n<p>Castells, Manuel. 2012. <em>Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age</em>.

During and in the aftermath of Gezi protests, the OP’s Facebook page was closed twice, and had to re-open under a different name on each occasion ([Guler 2013](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/facebook-facing-accusations-of-censoring-citizen-journalism.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=51996&amp;NewsCatID=374)). Responding to accusations of censorship, the Director of Facebook Policy in Europe claimed the pages shut down not because of their pro-Kurdish opinion but because they posted content praising the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S and the E.U. ([Basaran 2013](http://www.radikal.com.tr/yazarlar/ezgi_basaran/pkkya_ait_her_sey_kapatma_nedenidir-1148259)).\n\n![Facebook page of Otekilerin Postasi](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_nTb9F2ZQn91uPnZR3f537Q.png)\n\nAfter the Gezi protests waned, the affordances of social media were evident once again during the local elections of March 2014. In the period leading up to the elections, a number of civic initiatives emerged to increase voter turnout, monitor polling stations and prevent electoral fraud. They were mainly driven by the AKP’s increasing authoritarianism in the post-Gezi period and by widespread rumors about the party’s attempts to rig the elections. Among these initiatives 140journos and Oy ve Otesi (“Vote and Beyond”) particularly stood out. Oy ve Otesi was launched by eight volunteers to recruit, train and organize election monitors in Istanbul. Reaching out to the public via Twitter and Facebook, the initiative managed to enlist close to 30,000 volunteers who monitored 95% of polling stations in Istanbul on Election Day.\n\n![Facebook page of Oy ve Otesi announcing preparations for the presidential election](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_qvPBwrMeA4XVvh9R5XMS-g.png)\n\n&gt; &gt; The other prominent actor in the coordination of monitoring and verification of ballot box tabulations was 140journos.\n\nOn Election Day, 140journos urged citizens to send photographs of ballot box tabulations under the hashtag #tutanak. The team of volunteers aggregated nearly 6,000 received photos and compared them to official results published by the Election Board, and reported 250 irregularities ([Baykurt 2014](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/journos-mobile-platform-verifies-social-media-content-filters-citizen-reporting-and-extends-the-coverage-of-civic-news)).\n\n![Using hashtags #tutanakNO and #tutanak, citizens announced which ballot box tabulations had been missing](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_sJ_lnAGTsX5HsQyGz4TfQQ.png)\n\n140journos also developed a new web-based application to detect and report tabulation irregularities. Named Saydirac (“The Counter”), the application aims to enable citizens to enter data into the system which will then be compared to official results. 140journos launched Saydirac on June 1, 2014 when repeat elections were held in three provinces. One of 140journos’ co-founders, Cem Aydogdu notes that they hope Saydirac will facilitate active participation of citizens: “This is a tool designed to prevent a handful of individuals from shouldering the burden, a tool to prevent citizens from remaining on the sidelines and instead take responsibility for their own votes.”\n\n140journos used Saydirac again on August 10, 2014 — the day of the presidential election. It was joined by other initiatives that also organized volunteers and used social media to monitor and verify the votes. Among them were @Oy ve Otesi (Vote and Beyond), @SandikBasindayiz (We are at the Polls) and @TRnin Oylari (Turkey’s Votes) and its local branches in six major cities. Before the election, these groups organized close to 10,000 volunteers to work as “ballot box monitors,” posted YouTube training videos for them, and even set up 1–800 numbers in case they needed assistance. The presidential election was not as heated as the local elections back in March due to several reasons, most prominently because of low voter turnout. Accordingly, social media activity levels remained low compared to March elections.\n\n![@TRnin Oylari (Turkey’s Votes) had prepared this guideline for volunteers on how to report voting, tallying and other irregularities](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_IANpgH132oF17zXstxrJpQ.png)\n\n![The core of group of volunteers of Ankaranin Oylari (Ankara’s Votes) on the day of the Presidential election](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_PG6bkqODE51ZPUR-UzCSxg.png)\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe literature on the role of the Internet and digital communications regarding democratization, and social, political and economic change has generally centered on a dichotomy between cyber-utopians and skeptics. Whereas the utopian view holds that the Internet enables the emergence of a citizen-based, participatory democracy (Negroponte 1995, Dyson 1997, Shirky 2011), skeptics focus on the issues that emanate from corporate colonization, data mining, surveillance, digital divides, and nation-state censorship laws, and question the impact of connectivity on social movements and change (McChesney 2000, Margolis and Resnick 2000, Coleman and Blumler 2009, Morozov 2011). This split between the cyber-utopians and skeptics has deepened further in the aftermath of the protests in Iran in 2009 and the Arab uprisings in 2011 as the former group declared the Internet and social media “tools of change” that could defy authoritarian regimes (Diamond 2010, Stepanova 2011, Allagui and Keubler 2011, Sullivan 2009, “The Iranian Uprisings” 2013) while the latter interrogated the import of digital tools and instead emphasized the social, cultural, and political roots of the protests and the human agency behind them (Sreberny and Khiabany 2010, Deibert and Rohozinski 2011, Morozov 2011, Christensen 2011, Newsom, Lengel and Cassar 2011). This “conceptual gridlock” or “false dichotomy” between optimist and pessimist perspectives has inevitably led to the discussion of digital activism simply in terms of its effectiveness while ignoring other questions (Aouragh and Alexander 2014, Echchaibi 2013). To remedy this limited framework, researchers began to consider the Internet and forms of digital activism not merely as tools but rather as spaces and paid attention to the co-existence and co-evolution of technologies, practices and actors or the convergence of online and offline activism, for example (Khamis and Vaughn 2011, Trere 2012, Castells 2012, Aouragh and Alexander 2014, Echchaibi 2013).\n\nTo make sense of the aforementioned civic initiatives in Turkey, I adopt a similar line of thinking, and focus on their creative and insurgent capacities instead of evaluating their potential to dismantle the existing power structures. Here I draw upon Echchaibi’s argument that forms of digital activism, even in the absence of revolution, are significant because they create spaces of dissent. They show how “people confront power” through “a series of creative improvisations and flows, which may or may not lead to structural change” (2013, 865). It is this “act of doing” that is significant and deserves attention, not the end result (the defiance of the regime, the dismantling of the status quo, etc). Therefore the emphasis should be on the “sustained and disciplined online presence” of digital practices not their potential to subvert the system. In a similar vein, Aouragh and Alexander focus on the import of “spheres of dissidence” and discuss the Internet as a “space” of political activity rather than a tool. In light of these explorations, I consider the digitally-enabled initiatives in Turkey as noteworthy expressions of dissent, participation and civic engagement especially when one considers the broader media and political systems in which they operate.\n\nSimilar to other national contexts such as Iran, Russia, China to mention just a few, state control of the Internet looms large in Turkey. With the steady increase in the Internet use since the mid-2000s, the state’s efforts to confine the networked public sphere have amplified as seen in the filtering and blocking of online content, the construction of a strict legal framework, and more recently the demonization and banning of social media platforms (e.g. Twitter and YouTube bans of March 2014). So far, 140journos, Oy ve Otesi and others have not been faced with any blocking attempts or overt obstruction from the state (The Facebook pages of Otekilerin Postasi were closed numerous times, but one must remember that it was not upon the request of the Turkish government but by the company administration’s own initiative). The absence of state intervention can be attributed to a couple of factors: The ruling AKP party has cemented its hold over power to the extent that it does not deem these initiatives threatening at all. Or it is using them as “safety valves” so anti-government activists can express their frustration online or via these initiatives instead of organizing mass protests. It is also likely that the government is exploiting the presence of these initiatives so it can claim that there is freedom of speech in Turkey and ward off criticism.\n\nIt must also be noted that 140journos, Oy ve Otesi, Saydirac and TRnin Oylari bespeak the convergence of online and offline activism as well as the evolving relationships between traditional mass media and the Internet. For example, 140journos relies on its network of volunteers who post words and images from the street, while Oy ve Otesi, Saydirac and TRnin Oylari foster and build upon the physical presence of individuals at polling stations. Also, the input of these initiatives, be it the dissemination of news or the reporting of voting irregularities, are generally picked up by newspapers, television channels and online news sites. Therefore, it is important to analyze these initiatives not merely in terms of the Internet and digital connectivity, but within the framework of the larger media ecosystem, spatiality and mediation (McCurdy 2011, Castells 2012, Costanza-Chock 2012, Gebaudo 2012).\n\n# References\n\nAllagui, Ilhem and Johanne Keubler. 2011. “The Arab Spring and the Role of ICTs.” _International Journal of Communication_ 5: 1435–1442.\n\nAouragh, Miriam and Anne Alexander. 2014. “Egypt’s Unfinished Revolution: The Role of the Media Revisited.” _International Journal of Communication_ 8: 890–915.\n\nCastells, Manuel. 2012. _Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age_.

Their so-called Green Revolution, dubbed by foreign journalists as a Twitter Revolution, was live tweeted in a style of breaking-news journalism, making it also the first crowd-sourced Web broadcast of a world event.</p>\n<p>Since then, the use of Twitter has evolved from political activism to campaigning, with politicians around the world using it to mediate political change through self-promotion, education, agenda-setting, content discovery, and interpersonal communication.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Twitter’s campaign use came to the fore in the U.S. presidential election of 2012, and more recently, for the first time in Asia, in the other great aspiring democracy, India. Prominent Indian politicians were tweeting feverishly to influence voters in summer 2014 in the largest election the world had ever seen, the Indian parliamentary election.</p>\n<p>The quinquennial election, with 814 million voters of unparalleled cultural and economic diversity, saw some 8,000 candidates vying for 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, in all 28 states and seven Union territories. Indians staggered-voted on nine dates between April 7 and May 12, 2014. Politicians campaigned in open-air public rallies often in raucous, dusty and scorching conditions. In stump speeches, they invoked age-old themes of economic resurgence, national identity, and public accountability through hot-button issues: unemployment, secularism and corruption.</p>\n<p>For many politicians, it was also their first campaign mediated by Twitter, with loud outdoor rallies supplemented by air-conditioned indoor tweeting. Twitter, an efficient tool to reach tech-savvy urban voters, would be their site of vernacular written practice marked by stylistic heterogeneity and nonstandard use of English.</p>\n<p>This case study examined all tweets and retweets posted by the six most-followed Indian politicians over a 30-day campaign period beginning April 16, 2014. Together, the posts accounted for virtually all of the mainstream-media coverage of political tweets in the month preceding May 16, the day when the election results were declared.</p>\n<p>The six politicians stood out for sophistication of range, earnestness and strategy. They displayed a Twitter-focused mindset, expertly mobilizing supporters by using data to personalize as much as to localize. They seemed to have found a winning formula, if one ever existed in Twitter-mediated politics. They were, in order of Twitter popularity: Narendra Modi (Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP; 5.19 million Twitter followers); Shashi Tharoor (Congress Party; 2.25 million followers); Arvind Kejriwal (Aam Aadmi Party; 2.07 million followers); Subramanian Swamy (BJP; 681,000 followers); Arun Jaitley (BJP; 470,000 followers); and Digvijay Singh (Congress Party; 202,000 followers).</p>\n<p>All except Swamy and Singh were also candidates in the election. All were male, aged 45 (Kejriwal) to 74 (Swamy), and they represented five states: Gujarat, Kerala, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh respectively. They also represented the three prominent party options: Modi, Swamy and Jaitley were of the BJP, a 34-year-old party that had appropriated a platform of efficient governance and cultural nationalism. Tharoor and Singh were of the ruling 128-year-old Congress Party, which claimed a platform of secularism that it sought to contrast with the BJP’s nationalism. Kejriwal was from the 1-year-old Aam Aadmi Party which, after aggressively negative campaigning, had soared in popularity in the northern state of Delhi.</p>\n<p>The six politicians were expected to show strong purpose, strategy and focus to sell their respective party positions, but to also use ad hominem attacks, sarcasm, crotchety, or just a snarky tone to attack opponents. They were hypothesized to significantly use Twitter for negative campaigning. This case study examined their tweets for negative content over the 30-day period, ending May 15, when campaigning was at its most strident. It examined in all 996 tweets and retweets, operationalizing negativity as ad-hominem criticism, labeling, and other forms of attack targeting an individual or party.</p>\n<p>The use of negative campaign communication is native but not unique to Indian electoral politics. In the United States, proliferation of attack advertisements and negative appeals in commercials has accelerated since the early 1980s, but negativity in major-party presidential campaigns has not increased significantly. Candidates for public office in India and the United States have routinely used media opportunities, including broadcast commercials, cable interviews, media releases, and stump speeches as part of strategic campaign communication. Twitter is only the latest platform of negative campaigning.</p>\n<p>When Twitter turned eight years old in March 2014, it had 33 million monthly active users in India of the more than 242 million worldwide. With crumbling barriers of cost, technology and computer skill, a growing number of urban Indians were using the English-language platform but also, with aid of Quillpad and similar apps, non-English platforms. In July 2014, tweeters could type in ten of the 23 official Indian languages. Since its launch in 2011 in Hindi, the most spoken Indian language, Twitter access had greatly eased via its Translation Section. Continuing impediments to diffusion of Twitter use had to do primarily with a digital divide: India persistently had the lowest Internet penetration rate (13.7 percent according to the consulting firm eMarketer) and mean Internet speed (1.7 MBps, according to the Akamai State of the Internet Report; the global mean: 3.9 MBps) of the top ten Internet nations in July 2014. The number of Indian Internet users, however, grew 14 percent in the previous year, three-and-a-half times faster than Chinese and twice as fast as American users. At that rate, it could reach 340 million in 2015 to grow India from the third to the second largest Internet nation (after China.)</p>\n<p>The findings of the study were as follows. The most-followed politicians as a group were surprisingly non-negative. The most frequently negative tweeter was Digvijay Singh; more than a third of his tweets were negative. He was also the most intensely negative. Of Singh’s 72 tweets in the examined month, 26, or a full 36 percent, were of an attacking nature. Singh used more ad hominem criticisms than the other five politicians put together. His labels “communal,” “fascist,” “Hitler” and “desparadoes” most frequently targeted Modi. The least negative tweeter was Narendra Modi, of whose 343 tweets, 20, or 5.8 percent, were negative. He took one name in criticism, that of the Abdullah family of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>\n<p>Of the others, Shashi Tharoor posted 67 tweets, of which 13, or 19.4 percent, were negative. Tharoor’s eloquent criticism targeted none but Modi. Subramanian Swamy posted 280 tweets, of which 28, or 10 percent, were negative. Swamy used mocking monikers for the Nehru family and nick-named another opponent “rascal.” Of the politicians examined, Swamy used the most tweets for interpersonal communication, engaging frequently, and often curtly, with his followers. Arun Jaitley posted 47 tweets, of which 4, or 8.5 percent, were negative. Jaitley took no names in criticism. Finally, Arvind Kejriwal posted 187 tweets, of which 13, or 7 percent, were negative. Kejriwal’s tweets belied his television reputation of making sweeping and acrid attacks on opponents’ honesty.</p>\n<p>Later, the election results held a lesson for elevating the Twitter-mediated discourse. Modi and his party won handsomely and Singh’s party lost miserably, suggesting that if the Twitter campaign was significant at all, then Indian voters did not appreciate negative tweeting.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>Buell, Emmett H., and Sigelman Lee. 2008. <em>Attack Politics: Negativity in Presidential Campaigns Since 1960</em>.

Kejriwal’s tweets belied his television reputation of making sweeping and acrid attacks on opponents’ honesty.\n\nLater, the election results held a lesson for elevating the Twitter-mediated discourse. Modi and his party won handsomely and Singh’s party lost miserably, suggesting that if the Twitter campaign was significant at all, then Indian voters did not appreciate negative tweeting.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nBuell, Emmett H., and Sigelman Lee. 2008. _Attack Politics: Negativity in Presidential Campaigns Since 1960_.

As will become clear throughout this study, this particular instance of “hashtag-activism” changes the terms of this highly criticized form of early twenty-first century political, civic engagement. #MyNYPD demonstrates that, while a hashtag may not be able to effect physical change in the world in the way that a march, a sit-in, a rally, or the act of voting may be able to, it can effect significant change at the level of discourse and rhetoric. That is, this event shows the potential for hashtags and their function throughout digital social media to provide a model of political activism, of civic participation, aligned with staging a conversation, opening a dialog, or delivering a speech.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; On April 22, 2014, the New York Police Department experienced, first hand, the power of a well-placed (some may say misplaced) hashtag on twitter.</p>\n<p>At 10:55 a.m., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYPDnews\">@NYPDnews</a> tweeted: “Do you have a photo w/ a member of the NYPD?

As the model photo demonstrates, the expectation of this social media campaign was to elicit photographs of the New York citizenry being protected and served by New York’s Finest. Some Twitter users, like Lindsay Dixon (@poshwonderwoman) and JP Quinn (@JPQ904), responded with the expected photos and tweets. At 11:34 a.m., Dixon provided a picture of herself, smiling, surrounded by three uniformed officers with the 140 character caption: “@NYPDnews my photo from the ride along with the boys from the 90th pct #myNYPD,” (Dixon 2014) and at 10:59 a.m. Quinn tweeted a photo of a delightfully smirking Yankees fan posing with an equally jolly uniformed officer, captioned: “@NYPDnews #MyNYPD #MyBrother #YankeeStadium” (Quinn 2014).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_qkY5DuJXZspqbNc-.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Little more than an hour after @NYPDNews’s original tweet, however, the tide turned as twitter users co-opted the #myNYPD hashtag, mobilizing it to flood Twitter with photos of alleged police brutality. Sincere photos like Dixon’s and Quinn’s were quickly drowned by this continuous wave of violent images accompanied by biting, sarcastic captions. Occupy Wall Street (@OccupyWallStreetNYC), for example, posted an image of an officer in the act of forcefully swinging a baton at protestors with the caption “Here the #NYPD engages with its citizenry, changing hearts and minds one baton at a time. #MyNYPD” (Occupy Wall Street 2014).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_srDP8STwr4ZM3brF.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Similarly, Casey Aldridge (@CaseyJAldridge) tweeted an image of a man lying on the ground screaming as his leg is trapped under a police motorcycle. The caption accompanying this photo reads, “’And we’re going to have to run you over, just for good measure.’ #MyNYDP” (Aldridge 2014).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_WLPfH_BtLP6CdIGR.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By the end of the day, #MyNYPD was the top trending conversation on Twitter, having sparked a viral visualization of police brutality that raged across the country: from #MyNYPD to #MyLAPD and #MyOPD (Oakland), to #MyAPD (Albuquerque) and #MyCPD (Chicago). The original invitation to tweet a photo with a member of the NYPD with the hashtag #MyNYPD became an invitation to “post police brutality photos…that reveal the reality of your local police department, with the hashtag #My(Insert Your Corrupt Police Department Here)” (<a href=\"http://theantimedia.org/global-police-brutality-twitter-storm/\">Methyl 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>In what has become known as the NYPD’s comically disastrous #EpicFail, the NYPD did indeed learn a valuable lesson in viral media campaigning or “asking the internet to use a Twitter Hashtag” (<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-nypd-just-learned-a-very-valuable-lesson-about-asking-th\">Broderick 2014</a>). The lesson, of course, is that police officers may wield power in the physical world where, as the images make clear, they can make and break physical bodies. However, in the virtual world, in the “Twitterverse,” the power belongs to the tweeters, the hasthag users. As has been exhaustively observed in conversations about the relationship between hashtags and political activism — hashtag-activism or slacktivism as it is has been called — the use of a hashtag does not, in itself, have any effect on the physical world. #MyNYPD cannot break bodies like a baton, it cannot blind eyes like pepper spray, and it cannot stop hearts like bullets. Similarly, it cannot revive the bodies and rebuild the lives damaged by these tools, nor can it change the standards and laws governing police weaponry and their use. As Shonda Rhimes succinctly sums it up: “A hashtag does not make you Dr. King. A hashtag does not change anything. It’s a hashtag” (Rhimes 2014). The course of the #MyNYPD event, however, demonstrates the danger of this kind of dismissal for those whose power stands to be usurped by a surge of hashtaggers. Over the course of April 22, 2014, the balance of power shifted: the NYPD was no longer in charge of that hashtag, its meaning, or its usage. Indeed, more than two months after the event, the hashtag continues to be used to tag and signify police brutality rather than civil service.</p>\n<p>The pivot in the ability of the hashtag to signify is what marks this event as key in our discussions and considerations of civic media, or civic engagement through digital social media. Over the course of April 22, Twitter users wrested rhetorical and discursive power from the NYPD by changing the meaning of the #MyNYPD signifier. In other words, this event, mobilized by and around a hashtag, is significantly more than just “typing into your computer and going back to binge-watching your favorite show” (Rhimes 2014). It is typing into your computer and changing the very terms of what you have just typed. This is change bound to the level of the abstract and the virtual, certainly, but the abstract and the virtual is precisely the realm where public rhetoric functions, the space where discourse is located. That this iteration of discursive change was accompanied by a shift in power dynamics, an insistence on visibility and transparency, and a form of civic participation, housed in the twitter conversations of young people that spanned and continues to span beyond the United States, only marks it as that much more significant. What may have been an #EpicFail for the NYPD’s public relations team was an #EpicWin for the Twitterverse and its hashtagging “Slacktivists.”</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>Broderick, Ryan. “The NYPD Learned A Very Valuable Lesson About Asking The Internet To Use A Twitter Hashtag.” Buzzfeed, April 22, 2014, 3:22 p.m. <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-nypd-just-learned-a-very-valuable-lesson-about-asking-th.\">http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-nypd-just-learned-a-very-valuable-lesson-about-asking-th.</a></p>\n<p>Casey Aldridge, Casey.

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaefc6172290686e460d91"},"enabled":true,"title":"Blogging for Truth: Ai Weiwei’s Citizen Inevestigation Project on China’s 2008 Sichuan Eearthquake\n","body":{"html":"<h3 id=\"jian-xu-china-research-centre-university-of-technology-sydney\"><em>Jian Xu (</em>China Research Centre, University of Technology, Sydney)</h3>\n<p>On the afternoon of May 12, 2008, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit Sichuan province in China, killing at least 6,8000 people and leaving over 18,000 missing. The central government and the state media proactively reported the disaster, setting up “a major departure from China’s past tendency to conceal crises” (Tran 2008). However, the proactive and innovative crisis communication didn’t mean that the Chinese government had changed the conventional information control in the times of crisis (Tran 2008). Minefields still existed in the coverage of the Sichuan earthquake, such as the notorious schoolhouse construction scandal.</p>\n<p>The earthquake demolished over 7,000 classrooms, and killed thousands of students. The large death toll led to wide discussion about the quality of the school buildings. This, in turn, led to allegations of corruption against government officials and construction contractors, who were complicit in constructing sub-standard school buildings while pocketing the remaining surplus. The scandal soon became a focal point of reporting. Despite initial openness to media’s crisis reporting, the Chinese government issued notice to media outlets ordering them to downplay the issue, and forced China’s most famous liberal press, Southern Metropolis Daily and foreign media to withdraw from the earthquake zone in case they further investigated the scandal (Weaver 2008). When media’s investigative reporting of the scandal was suppressed, some social activists, public intellectuals, and activist bloggers initiated independent investigation projects to further look into the issue. Amongst them, Ai Weiwei’s citizen investigation project was one of the most well-known and influential projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_nAmzVmNRggn6kwwS.png\" alt=\"An informal gathering of parents whose children were crushed to death in shoddy schoolhouses commemorated their children at Juyuan Middile School in Dujiangyan, one of the most destroyed areas in the Sichuan earthquake, on May 27, 2008 (Jacobs 2008).\"></p>\n<p>As a contemporary artist and intellectual activist with international reputation, Ai Weiwei was unsatisfied with the government’s refusal to release the death toll of the students. He intended to compile a name list of schoolchildren killed in the school buildings by doing independent investigation. In an interview about his investigation, Ai Weiwei argued “all citizens should have the rights to supervise the government, as well as the responsibility to investigate the truth when the government keeps silent” (Wu 2009). The main purpose of the project was to “show respect to every individual victim’s life and refuse to forget the tragedy” (Wu 2009).</p>\n<p>On December 15, 2008, Ai Weiwei’s Citizen Investigation Group (CIG) was formally set up in his studio in Beijing. The CIG started collecting profiles of student casualties through limited online information, such as mourning websites and reports from NGOs. In order to obtain complete information, on January 17, 2009, CIG sent 4 volunteers to Sichuan to collect students’ profiles. They visited 21 villages and towns, interviewed the parents of the student victims, and shot scenes of the collapsed schools, obtaining valuable audio-visual materials from the disastrous area. They further sorted out the materials, compiled name lists of student victims in different schools, and sent the lists to the head office in Beijing via email. On March 15, Ai Weiwei released, on his personal blogs, the first investigation report on China’s two major commercial portal sites: <em>Sina</em> and <em>Sohu (</em>Hassid, 2012), based on the information provided by CIG. Tianya Forum — China’s most influential Bulletin Board System (BBS) with nearly 92 million registers — soon reposted the report, which gave rise to heated online discussion about Ai Weiwei’s citizen investigation. The suppressed schoolhouse construction scandal re-entered the public discursive sphere through alternative online communication. Ai Weiwei’s blogs soon became reliable information sources for those who wanted to know the truth of the scandal.</p>\n<p>Having attracted great attention from the public, Ai Weiwei began to use blogs to mobilize the public to participate in his project. On March 20, he posted advertisement to recruit volunteers. The ad received considerable feedbacks from the audience; and from March 25 to April 21, three batches of volunteers (18, 9, and 11 people, respectively) were recruited and sent to Sichuan. Ai Weiwei kept blogging with the first-hand information sent from the front-line. From March 21 to May 29, Ai Weiwei had posted 202 blog entries to release the name lists of student victims and 115 entries to document the volunteers’ investigation. The page view of his blogs reached more than 10 million. In addition, his blog entries were widely circulated and reposted on BBS, blogs and instant messaging platforms, such as QQ and MSN, <a href=\"http://aiweiwei.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/%E5%85%AC%E6%B0%91%E8%B0%83%E6%9F%A5%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%BE%EF%BC%882008%E5%B9%B405%E6%9C%8812%E6%97%A5%EF%BC%8D2010%E5%B9%B405%E6%9C%8812%E6%97%A5%EF%BC%89.pdf\">making his investigation a hot Internet event</a>.</p>\n<p>Banned by China’s mainstream media as a politically sensitive topic, Ai Weiwei sought attention from overseas media outlets to publicize his investigation result. By May 8, 2009, he had accepted nearly 70 interviews from overseas media, including NBC, BBC, Reuters and NHK, which put the Chinese government under pressure. Under attack both internally (cyberspace) and externally (international societies), the government finally released the death toll of the schoolchildren on May 7, 2009. A total number of 5, 335 students were confirmed dead or missing in the Sichuan earthquake (Ang 2009).

The central government and the state media proactively reported the disaster, setting up “a major departure from China’s past tendency to conceal crises” (Tran 2008). However, the proactive and innovative crisis communication didn’t mean that the Chinese government had changed the conventional information control in the times of crisis (Tran 2008). Minefields still existed in the coverage of the Sichuan earthquake, such as the notorious schoolhouse construction scandal.\n\nThe earthquake demolished over 7,000 classrooms, and killed thousands of students. The large death toll led to wide discussion about the quality of the school buildings. This, in turn, led to allegations of corruption against government officials and construction contractors, who were complicit in constructing sub-standard school buildings while pocketing the remaining surplus. The scandal soon became a focal point of reporting. Despite initial openness to media’s crisis reporting, the Chinese government issued notice to media outlets ordering them to downplay the issue, and forced China’s most famous liberal press, Southern Metropolis Daily and foreign media to withdraw from the earthquake zone in case they further investigated the scandal (Weaver 2008). When media’s investigative reporting of the scandal was suppressed, some social activists, public intellectuals, and activist bloggers initiated independent investigation projects to further look into the issue. Amongst them, Ai Weiwei’s citizen investigation project was one of the most well-known and influential projects.\n\n![An informal gathering of parents whose children were crushed to death in shoddy schoolhouses commemorated their children at Juyuan Middile School in Dujiangyan, one of the most destroyed areas in the Sichuan earthquake, on May 27, 2008 (Jacobs 2008).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_nAmzVmNRggn6kwwS.png)\n\nAs a contemporary artist and intellectual activist with international reputation, Ai Weiwei was unsatisfied with the government’s refusal to release the death toll of the students. He intended to compile a name list of schoolchildren killed in the school buildings by doing independent investigation. In an interview about his investigation, Ai Weiwei argued “all citizens should have the rights to supervise the government, as well as the responsibility to investigate the truth when the government keeps silent” (Wu 2009). The main purpose of the project was to “show respect to every individual victim’s life and refuse to forget the tragedy” (Wu 2009).\n\nOn December 15, 2008, Ai Weiwei’s Citizen Investigation Group (CIG) was formally set up in his studio in Beijing. The CIG started collecting profiles of student casualties through limited online information, such as mourning websites and reports from NGOs. In order to obtain complete information, on January 17, 2009, CIG sent 4 volunteers to Sichuan to collect students’ profiles. They visited 21 villages and towns, interviewed the parents of the student victims, and shot scenes of the collapsed schools, obtaining valuable audio-visual materials from the disastrous area. They further sorted out the materials, compiled name lists of student victims in different schools, and sent the lists to the head office in Beijing via email. On March 15, Ai Weiwei released, on his personal blogs, the first investigation report on China’s two major commercial portal sites: _Sina_ and *Sohu (*Hassid, 2012), based on the information provided by CIG. Tianya Forum — China’s most influential Bulletin Board System (BBS) with nearly 92 million registers — soon reposted the report, which gave rise to heated online discussion about Ai Weiwei’s citizen investigation. The suppressed schoolhouse construction scandal re-entered the public discursive sphere through alternative online communication. Ai Weiwei’s blogs soon became reliable information sources for those who wanted to know the truth of the scandal.\n\nHaving attracted great attention from the public, Ai Weiwei began to use blogs to mobilize the public to participate in his project. On March 20, he posted advertisement to recruit volunteers. The ad received considerable feedbacks from the audience; and from March 25 to April 21, three batches of volunteers (18, 9, and 11 people, respectively) were recruited and sent to Sichuan. Ai Weiwei kept blogging with the first-hand information sent from the front-line. From March 21 to May 29, Ai Weiwei had posted 202 blog entries to release the name lists of student victims and 115 entries to document the volunteers’ investigation. The page view of his blogs reached more than 10 million. In addition, his blog entries were widely circulated and reposted on BBS, blogs and instant messaging platforms, such as QQ and MSN, [making his investigation a hot Internet event](http://aiweiwei.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/%E5%85%AC%E6%B0%91%E8%B0%83%E6%9F%A5%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%BE%EF%BC%882008%E5%B9%B405%E6%9C%8812%E6%97%A5%EF%BC%8D2010%E5%B9%B405%E6%9C%8812%E6%97%A5%EF%BC%89.pdf).\n\nBanned by China’s mainstream media as a politically sensitive topic, Ai Weiwei sought attention from overseas media outlets to publicize his investigation result. By May 8, 2009, he had accepted nearly 70 interviews from overseas media, including NBC, BBC, Reuters and NHK, which put the Chinese government under pressure. Under attack both internally (cyberspace) and externally (international societies), the government finally released the death toll of the schoolchildren on May 7, 2009. A total number of 5, 335 students were confirmed dead or missing in the Sichuan earthquake (Ang 2009). However, the names of the lost schoolchildren were not attached with the official figure.\n\n&gt; &gt; Due to the great social influence of Ai Weiwei’s investigation and blogs, the government shut down his blogs on May 29.\n\nLosing the blogging platforms in domestic cyberspace, he moved his blog overseas. He reposted all blog entries on _Bullogger.com_, a Chinese political website with server based in the US, and continued blogging (All his blog entries about citizen investigation can be found on his personal homepage [http://aiweiwei.com](http://aiweiwei.com)).

Extending Gauntlett’s definition of “new creative methods… an alternative to language driven qualitative research methods,” (Gauntlett 2007), GRT is an important contribution to the growing body of literature on creative and participatory approaches to data collection. GRT is an evolution of participatory action research (Kindon et al. 2008) and unobtrusive research methods (Kellehear 1993). Researchers can use GRT as an alternative, creative approach to data acquisition that allows them to engage with the public as active co-creators of knowledge. This case study offers a brief summary of some of the previous work in this area to illustrate what GRT is and how it might be used.</p>\n<p>The GRT project drew out of small-scale experiments such as Print + Talk = Love (PTL). This was a situated paper-based intervention that invited ordinary citizens to discuss place-based topics that had no connections to digital devices or web based platforms. PTL was constructed by a large piece of corrugated cardboard that had pinned pieces of paper with printed questions relating to the event or place in which the intervention was located as seen in figure 1. Clips and string were used to attach colored pens to the board. The pieces of paper had blank space allowing for participants to write their responses to such questions as, “What’s your great idea for Grey St.?” (Parra-Agudelo et al. 2013). The board was interactive, allowing participants to express themselves on paper through their own personalized way of manipulating, writing, drawing or repositioning the pieces of paper.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_ko8sR2exAQM_eBkl.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1 Photo: Mark Bilandzic. Print + Talk = Love at the Changing Lanes event in Brisbane, QLD May 2012\"></p>\n<p>PTL was purposely designed to be easy to use and easy to interact with. When deploying PTL its location and setup was considered carefully along with its visibility and content. All of which contributed to the ability for researchers to stand back and allow for unobtrusive observation (Parra-Agudelo et al. 2013).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_d3iBW25WrT-6Bmf_.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2 Photo: Mark Bilandzic. Print + Talk = Love, Brisbane, QLD May 2012\"></p>\n<p>Another experiment involving an interactive application on urban screens was Discussions in Space (DIS), a public participation tool for urban public places (Schroeter 2012; Schroeter et al. 2012). DIS allowed situated users to respond to context specific questions such as “Brisbane’s laneways need more…?” through SMS, Twitter, and a website, as shown in figure 2. The responses and messages are revealed on the dynamic screen in an animated way.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; DIS has demonstrated that when it is situated within the right parameters, it can be a useful tool in collecting urban planning data from young people who generally do not participate in typical community consultation processes (Schroeter 2012; Schroeter et al. 2012).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0__IqzP93fBDTzneon.png\" alt=\"Figure 3 Photo: Glenda Caldwell. Discussions in Space at the Changing Lanes event in Brisbane, QLD May 2012\"></p>\n<p>Researchers employing PTL and DIS extended their data beyond the comments collected; they also conducted unobtrusive observations, photographs, and video recordings to examine how users interacted with the displays. In the case of DIS, geo-locative data was available through some of the twitter comments.</p>\n<p>Confronted with the challenge of engaging research participants, a group of Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, researchers began to interrogate the impact of activating PTL and DIS in public spaces and test their effectiveness as potential research tools. Providing researchers with both analogue and digital examples of experimental interventions allowed for researchers to trial and experiment with a range of research approaches. Analogue, digital, and hybrid (analogue and digital) variations of PTL and DIS were implemented in Australia and New Zealand, encouraging participants to engage both with the physical intervention and accompanying digital websites and surveys.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_YI15okFXvxaWJD2f.png\" alt=\"Figure 4 Photo: Louise Barbour.

The Puzzle of Collaboration\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3 is a photo of a variation of PTL used to engage with Fashion Design students in a study about studio based learning environments. The researcher designed the pieces of paper to resemble Polaroids. The papers also had a mix of a few different questions and ultimately used this approach to collect data instead of a survey or questionnaire. Another adaptation of PTL is shown in figure 5 called the Puzzle of Collaboration where the researcher was examining the motivation behind interdisciplinary collaboration. This adaptation used colored pieces of paper that were cut into puzzle pieces where participants could write their responses to targeted questions. The papers were pinned on the board and fit together as a large puzzle.</p>\n<p>Mural Wall was a hybrid adaptation of PTL, which was used to engage with the public to question their preference for design ideas of a third place for an underutilized railway underpass (Caldwell et al. 2013). Five hand drawn vignettes — such as the one in figure 5 — were posted on a large corrugated cardboard depicting potential uses for that location, and participants were invited to vote for their preferred design idea by using sticky dots and post-it notes. The Mural Wall also included QR codes that linked to a wordpress site that included more information about the research project such as ethical clearance, survey and social media links, and research team information (Caldwell et al. 2013).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_3EE59FE8fPsDWim3.png\" alt=\"Figure 6: illustrated design vignette. The Mural Wall\"></p>\n<p>More projects began to be conceived in the same GRT mode, for example a hybrid approach called “Poll Bombing”: the strategic placement of physical artifacts with embedded QR codes linked to web-based surveys and polls. Figure 6 is an example of an origami paper crane that was placed in targeted locations. The paper used text and words to express the research topic in question.

It is not a straightforward process. Guerrilla research tactics requires creative design thinking, the desire to make tangible artifacts as well as clever use of social media, ubiquitous technologies, and a willingness to explore alternative research methodologies. GRT should be easy to implement and easy to use. Influenced by guerrilla activism, the key characteristics of GRT is a political agenda, the use of the unexpected, and the unconventional design that created opportunities for interactive, unique and thought-provoking experiences for the researcher and participant alike (Caldwell et al. 2014). Burgess et al. (2006) argue that active citizenship is practiced by everyday people through their day to day life, leisure and entertainment activities, as much as through formal political debate and engagement. GRT draws on these everyday practices to provide researchers tools for gathering information from larger parts of society.</p>\n<p>As a form of participatory action research, GRT encourages the collaboration of researchers and participants in reviewing and questioning problems pertaining to space and place, social and natural environments. As such it can be understood that GRT is a ‘bottom up process’ where data emerges from interactions with the urban fabric itself (Kindon et al. 2008; Caldwell et al. 2014). The process of generating data encourages participants to reflect upon local issues that are directly related to them and consider actions that are required to create positive change (Kindon et al. 2008). Through GRT, civic research has the capacity to promote active citizenship (Burgess et al. 2006) and effect positive change in urban environments.</p>\n<p>Part of the GRT framework involves implementing unexpected design interventions in urban locations so that passers-by are confronted with an element of surprise and intrigue. By luring people to participate and interact with the intervention, researchers can increase the possibility that passers-by become involved in the discussion and advocate for their opinions and ideas. Motivation and empowerment for participants are critical elements of GRT. The collection of information from people, how and for what purposes it is used and how that information is revealed to others, does, however, need careful consideration.</p>\n<p>GRT faces many challenges. Of foremost concern is to ensure that data is collected ethically and that participants are aware of their actions. This comes into tension with the ability to conduct unobtrusive observations where the researchers do not influence the actions of participants. GRT may also be difficult to understand by users who do not recognize the intention of the interventions, and are not aware of how they can participate or interact with them. Environmental factors such as inclement weather and lighting also have to be acknowledged and considered when designing and deploying GRT (In windy or wet conditions how does the researcher ensure the stability and security of its implementation?).

Extending Gauntlett’s definition of “new creative methods… an alternative to language driven qualitative research methods,” (Gauntlett 2007), GRT is an important contribution to the growing body of literature on creative and participatory approaches to data collection. GRT is an evolution of participatory action research (Kindon et al. 2008) and unobtrusive research methods (Kellehear 1993). Researchers can use GRT as an alternative, creative approach to data acquisition that allows them to engage with the public as active co-creators of knowledge. This case study offers a brief summary of some of the previous work in this area to illustrate what GRT is and how it might be used.\n\nThe GRT project drew out of small-scale experiments such as Print + Talk = Love (PTL). This was a situated paper-based intervention that invited ordinary citizens to discuss place-based topics that had no connections to digital devices or web based platforms. PTL was constructed by a large piece of corrugated cardboard that had pinned pieces of paper with printed questions relating to the event or place in which the intervention was located as seen in figure 1. Clips and string were used to attach colored pens to the board. The pieces of paper had blank space allowing for participants to write their responses to such questions as, “What’s your great idea for Grey St.?” (Parra-Agudelo et al. 2013). The board was interactive, allowing participants to express themselves on paper through their own personalized way of manipulating, writing, drawing or repositioning the pieces of paper.\n\n![Figure 1 Photo: Mark Bilandzic. Print + Talk = Love at the Changing Lanes event in Brisbane, QLD May 2012](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_ko8sR2exAQM_eBkl.jpg)\n\nPTL was purposely designed to be easy to use and easy to interact with. When deploying PTL its location and setup was considered carefully along with its visibility and content. All of which contributed to the ability for researchers to stand back and allow for unobtrusive observation (Parra-Agudelo et al. 2013).\n\n![Figure 2 Photo: Mark Bilandzic. Print + Talk = Love, Brisbane, QLD May 2012](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_d3iBW25WrT-6Bmf_.jpg)\n\nAnother experiment involving an interactive application on urban screens was Discussions in Space (DIS), a public participation tool for urban public places (Schroeter 2012; Schroeter et al. 2012). DIS allowed situated users to respond to context specific questions such as “Brisbane’s laneways need more…?” through SMS, Twitter, and a website, as shown in figure 2. The responses and messages are revealed on the dynamic screen in an animated way.\n\n&gt; &gt; DIS has demonstrated that when it is situated within the right parameters, it can be a useful tool in collecting urban planning data from young people who generally do not participate in typical community consultation processes (Schroeter 2012; Schroeter et al. 2012).\n\n![Figure 3 Photo: Glenda Caldwell. Discussions in Space at the Changing Lanes event in Brisbane, QLD May 2012](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0__IqzP93fBDTzneon.png)\n\nResearchers employing PTL and DIS extended their data beyond the comments collected; they also conducted unobtrusive observations, photographs, and video recordings to examine how users interacted with the displays. In the case of DIS, geo-locative data was available through some of the twitter comments.\n\nConfronted with the challenge of engaging research participants, a group of Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, researchers began to interrogate the impact of activating PTL and DIS in public spaces and test their effectiveness as potential research tools. Providing researchers with both analogue and digital examples of experimental interventions allowed for researchers to trial and experiment with a range of research approaches. Analogue, digital, and hybrid (analogue and digital) variations of PTL and DIS were implemented in Australia and New Zealand, encouraging participants to engage both with the physical intervention and accompanying digital websites and surveys.\n\n![Figure 4 Photo: Louise Barbour. Situated paper-based design intervention](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_YI15okFXvxaWJD2f.png)\n\n![Figure 5 Photo: Lindy Osborne. The Puzzle of Collaboration](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_nviu_omcX25blb7Z.png)\n\nFigure 3 is a photo of a variation of PTL used to engage with Fashion Design students in a study about studio based learning environments. The researcher designed the pieces of paper to resemble Polaroids. The papers also had a mix of a few different questions and ultimately used this approach to collect data instead of a survey or questionnaire. Another adaptation of PTL is shown in figure 5 called the Puzzle of Collaboration where the researcher was examining the motivation behind interdisciplinary collaboration. This adaptation used colored pieces of paper that were cut into puzzle pieces where participants could write their responses to targeted questions. The papers were pinned on the board and fit together as a large puzzle.\n\nMural Wall was a hybrid adaptation of PTL, which was used to engage with the public to question their preference for design ideas of a third place for an underutilized railway underpass (Caldwell et al. 2013). Five hand drawn vignettes — such as the one in figure 5 — were posted on a large corrugated cardboard depicting potential uses for that location, and participants were invited to vote for their preferred design idea by using sticky dots and post-it notes. The Mural Wall also included QR codes that linked to a wordpress site that included more information about the research project such as ethical clearance, survey and social media links, and research team information (Caldwell et al. 2013).\n\n![Figure 6: illustrated design vignette. The Mural Wall](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_3EE59FE8fPsDWim3.png)\n\nMore projects began to be conceived in the same GRT mode, for example a hybrid approach called “Poll Bombing”: the strategic placement of physical artifacts with embedded QR codes linked to web-based surveys and polls. Figure 6 is an example of an origami paper crane that was placed in targeted locations. The paper used text and words to express the research topic in question. It also had a sign asking for the participant to unfold the crane and look inside it. On the inside a QR code was found which when scanned would take the user to the survey.\n\n![Figure 7 Photo: Glenda Caldwell. A paper crane with a QR code inside](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_H1wVipVCp2Hj_fUy.png)\n\n![Figure 8 Photo: Leonardo Parra Agudelo. Pink stickers placed in urban environments](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_11usAdjVAZ6wuP0-.png)\n\nA similar approach was the use of carefully designed stickers placed in urban spaces shown in figure 7. The stickers used bright colors and simple graphics and text to ask open-ended and location specific questions, such as, “This space needs…” The sticker also included a QR code taking the participant to a website that contained more information about the research project.\n\nSocial media, predominately Facebook and Twitter, were employed as a means to disseminate links to the websites, surveys, and blogs extending the access to research participants well beyond the physical location in which the interventions were placed.\n\nThe success of guerrilla research tactics relies on the ability for researchers to appropriate and adapt their methods to create context specific applications and interventions.

To encourage people to join the protesters Rony, 23 years old, was using the hashtag “#VemPraRua” (in English, come out to the streets):</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“We can’t be afraid of getting beat up… That’s already happening.

They were demanding better living conditions in the favelas, more respect as citizens, and the end of the drug war. Rony considered the participation an important beginning for the dwellers:</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; <em>“It is just the start… we still have a lot to fight for.

But the social divide that takes place in Vitória affected the way information flowed, impacting the civic engagement of the poor. The organizers of the first protests belonged to an upper class that did not overlap with lower classes, online and offline, the marginalized came in late to the streets and their voices and requests were not privileged as the ones shouted by the rich.</p>\n<p><em>If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

To encourage people to join the protesters Rony, 23 years old, was using the hashtag “#VemPraRua” (in English, come out to the streets):\n\n&gt; &gt; _“We can’t be afraid of getting beat up… That’s already happening. If we don’t do anything then things won’t change and my people from the favela will still have no access to education and health care… I don’t want this life… We already have 107 people in the Facebook group and they all said they are going to the next protest.”_\n\n![Photo 2 — Sign with the message: “In June 20th #ComeOutToTheStreets , wake up Brazil ; no violence.”](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_uTIMbbsPPnvsSYnA.jpg)\n\n**The protests of June 20th made history by gathering more than 100.000 protesters in the streets of Vitória and forming the largest public demonstration ever registered in the state of Espírito Santo.**\n\n19 out 30 of my informants and favela dwellers were present in the protest. They were demanding better living conditions in the favelas, more respect as citizens, and the end of the drug war. Rony considered the participation an important beginning for the dwellers:\n\n&gt; &gt; _“It is just the start… we still have a lot to fight for. I wonder if our voices will ever be heard by the politicians… Facebook turned out to be a good way to reach out for people spread all over the communities… The group gave the privacy we needed to discuss sensitive and critical issues, such as the drug cartel activities, without getting people in trouble.”_\n\n![Photo 3 — Sign with the message “We got out of Facebook” (in reference that protesters were serious about their plans made online).](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_brNjq1E9ARHY8Nwi.jpg)\n\nEven though the people facing digital inequalities in the marginalized areas came late to the protest, Facebook still provided a platform so the residents of Gurigica, São Benedito and Itararé could organize and manifest their demands in the street protest. But the social divide that takes place in Vitória affected the way information flowed, impacting the civic engagement of the poor. The organizers of the first protests belonged to an upper class that did not overlap with lower classes, online and offline, the marginalized came in late to the streets and their voices and requests were not privileged as the ones shouted by the rich.\n\n_If you like what you just read, please click the green ‘Recommend’ button below to spread the word!

The blue-and-yellow logo offered a bold design that was cheap to produce and immediately recognizable.</p>\n<p>However, the Human Rights Campaign’s recent success in helping overturn Proposition 8 in California and the Defense of Marriage Act relied on successful and strategic use of social media to tap into the emotional and influential power of networks. While social media tools have already become mainstream, research illustrates that many companies fail to utilize social media to engage with consumers beyond mere one-way communication (Briones et al. 2011, 40). Companies and organizations that do not keep up with the rapidly changing world of social media may neglect to tap in to the “large-scale mobilization among individuals … based on new person-to-person connections” these networks offer (Cockerill 2013, 40).</p>\n<p>The HRC regularly sends free bumper stickers in the mail to support “an America where you can’t get fired just because you are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or where all people who love and commit to each other can finally marry” (“Request a Free” 2014). The sticker, a tangible reminder of the HRC’s mission, costs pennies to create which helps ensure its spread (“About Our Logo” 2011).</p>\n<p>In March 2013, to bring attention to the United States Supreme Court cases on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, the HRC modified its logo by changing its colors to red and pink — colors frequently associated with romance and love (see Figure 1.2).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_xxp2CW-9g3cSb4-b.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.2\"></p>\n<p>The day before the Supreme Court was scheduled to start deliberations on Proposition 8, the HRC posted on Facebook encouraging users to adopt the modified logo as their profile picture. “Share this image and ask your friends and family to join you!” stated one update on March 25, 2013. Another asked, “Who’s wearing red tomorrow? Show your support for marriage equality — make your profile image red for tomorrow and check out <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/StandForMarriage\">www.hrc.org/StandForMarriage</a> for more ways to get involved!” (See Figure 1.3)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_teF3dE47HqrmNkg2.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.3\"></p>\n<p>Those two Facebook posts have been liked over 27,000 times and shared nearly 125,000 times as of August 2014, showing the massive viral impact of the HRC’s modified logo campaign. The logo spread and modified through the network. Many modifications included LGBT couples, real and imagined, like the Statue of Liberty kissing Justice (see figure 1.4)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_5jyBRjuwhvX3ADZp.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.4\"></p>\n<p>or Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie (see figure 1.5).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_38VG9WHoPUfEghjw.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.5\"></p>\n<p>Because the variants relied on collective symbols “immediately understood by members of the same speech community,” they thrived (Wodak and Reisigl 2001, 381). Their success depended upon viewers’ collective responses to recognizable figures such as the State of Liberty and to iconic, culturally embedded figures. Similarly, variants were frequently championed by “influencers” with desirable attributes like high levels of credibility, expertise, enthusiasm, or connectivity (Bakshy et al. 2011, 65–74). Notable influencers in this campaign included Martha Stewart, George Takei, and Beyoncé, who helped spread the logo to their millions of followers. (However, influencers are not always celebrities, but simply individuals with powerful significance within a network.)</p>\n<p>How far did the logo and variants spread? Significantly more users (approximately 2.7 million more, an increase of 120%) updated their profile photo on Tuesday, March 26, 2013 as compared to the previous Tuesday (Bakshy 2013). While some likely changed their profile pictures to something other than the HRC logo, this significant increase illustrates the impact of the campaign. Social networking site users tend to adopt online content shared by friends; those rates of adoption increase as additional friends adopt as well (Bakshy, Karrer, and Adamic 2009, 334). This social contagion model showcases why examining even seemingly insignificant online elements such as memes is important.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; This logo played a significant role in the moments leading up to the Supreme Court’s dismissal of Proposition 8.</p>\n<p>It drove new traffic to the website with over 700,000 unique visitors in a 24-hour period around March 26; almost 90% were new to the site (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.). They signed and shared the HRC’s “Majority Opinion” petition, recruiting more than 67,000 new supporters (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.). The HRC released a video from Hillary Clinton proclaiming her support for marriage equality. Finally, five U.S. Senators noted their support for Proposition 8’s dismissal during this time and the HRC shared their support through Facebook blog posts and images (see figure 1.6) (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_8e3_5L0bvrod7hDF.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.6\"></p>\n<p>These elements worked together to create “a widespread descriptive norm implying that it is socially acceptable to advocate for same-sex marriage,” leading to real-world impacts (Tannenbaum 2013). The power of norms can be more influential than the power of law and order; change often occurs through specific platforms where online sociality bleeds over into offline life (van Dijck 2013, 19).</p>\n<p>From Internet memes and the Occupy Wall Street movement, Twitter hashtags and climate change protests, and political messages spread through Facebook and voting behaviors, online actions are intertwined in a complex ecology of activism. This complex ecology of activism includes offline actions, the actions of one’s friends and personal network, and non-human influencers such as tweets, memes, and status posts (Milner 2013; Segerberg and Bennett 2011; Bond et al. 2012). When considering the impact of social media on policy, institutions and organizations must attend to both the power of influencers in the network and the power of the meme itself to tap into a collective social consciousness. Without harnessing the power of influencers in the network, online activism may not spread rapidly or as far as it will when championed by these individuals. And without creating online campaigns that tap into people’s emotional or cultural ties, online activism may similarly fail to gain a foothold. The HRC logo illustrates the powerful potential that can occur when campaigns tap into emotional foundations of a collective and rely on the ability of both influencers and everyday individuals within large-scale networks.</p>\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<p>“About Our Logo.” Human Rights Campaign. 2011. <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo.\">http://www.hrc.org/the-hrc-story/about-our-logo.</a></p>\n<p>Bakshy, Eytan. “Showing Support for Marriage Equality on Facebook.” Facebook.

Companies and organizations that do not keep up with the rapidly changing world of social media may neglect to tap in to the “large-scale mobilization among individuals … based on new person-to-person connections” these networks offer (Cockerill 2013, 40).\n\nThe HRC regularly sends free bumper stickers in the mail to support “an America where you can’t get fired just because you are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or where all people who love and commit to each other can finally marry” (“Request a Free” 2014). The sticker, a tangible reminder of the HRC’s mission, costs pennies to create which helps ensure its spread (“About Our Logo” 2011).\n\nIn March 2013, to bring attention to the United States Supreme Court cases on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, the HRC modified its logo by changing its colors to red and pink — colors frequently associated with romance and love (see Figure 1.2).\n\n![Figure 1.2](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_xxp2CW-9g3cSb4-b.jpg)\n\nThe day before the Supreme Court was scheduled to start deliberations on Proposition 8, the HRC posted on Facebook encouraging users to adopt the modified logo as their profile picture. “Share this image and ask your friends and family to join you!” stated one update on March 25, 2013. Another asked, “Who’s wearing red tomorrow? Show your support for marriage equality — make your profile image red for tomorrow and check out [www.hrc.org/StandForMarriage](http://www.hrc.org/StandForMarriage) for more ways to get involved!” (See Figure 1.3)\n\n![Figure 1.3](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_teF3dE47HqrmNkg2.jpg)\n\nThose two Facebook posts have been liked over 27,000 times and shared nearly 125,000 times as of August 2014, showing the massive viral impact of the HRC’s modified logo campaign. The logo spread and modified through the network. Many modifications included LGBT couples, real and imagined, like the Statue of Liberty kissing Justice (see figure 1.4)\n\n![Figure 1.4](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_5jyBRjuwhvX3ADZp.jpg)\n\nor Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie (see figure 1.5).\n\n![Figure 1.5](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_38VG9WHoPUfEghjw.jpg)\n\nBecause the variants relied on collective symbols “immediately understood by members of the same speech community,” they thrived (Wodak and Reisigl 2001, 381). Their success depended upon viewers’ collective responses to recognizable figures such as the State of Liberty and to iconic, culturally embedded figures. Similarly, variants were frequently championed by “influencers” with desirable attributes like high levels of credibility, expertise, enthusiasm, or connectivity (Bakshy et al. 2011, 65–74). Notable influencers in this campaign included Martha Stewart, George Takei, and Beyoncé, who helped spread the logo to their millions of followers. (However, influencers are not always celebrities, but simply individuals with powerful significance within a network.)\n\nHow far did the logo and variants spread? Significantly more users (approximately 2.7 million more, an increase of 120%) updated their profile photo on Tuesday, March 26, 2013 as compared to the previous Tuesday (Bakshy 2013). While some likely changed their profile pictures to something other than the HRC logo, this significant increase illustrates the impact of the campaign. Social networking site users tend to adopt online content shared by friends; those rates of adoption increase as additional friends adopt as well (Bakshy, Karrer, and Adamic 2009, 334). This social contagion model showcases why examining even seemingly insignificant online elements such as memes is important.\n\n&gt; &gt; This logo played a significant role in the moments leading up to the Supreme Court’s dismissal of Proposition 8.\n\nIt drove new traffic to the website with over 700,000 unique visitors in a 24-hour period around March 26; almost 90% were new to the site (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.). They signed and shared the HRC’s “Majority Opinion” petition, recruiting more than 67,000 new supporters (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.). The HRC released a video from Hillary Clinton proclaiming her support for marriage equality. Finally, five U.S. Senators noted their support for Proposition 8’s dismissal during this time and the HRC shared their support through Facebook blog posts and images (see figure 1.6) (“Marriage at the U.S. Supreme Court” n.d.).\n\n![Figure 1.6](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_8e3_5L0bvrod7hDF.jpg)\n\nThese elements worked together to create “a widespread descriptive norm implying that it is socially acceptable to advocate for same-sex marriage,” leading to real-world impacts (Tannenbaum 2013). The power of norms can be more influential than the power of law and order; change often occurs through specific platforms where online sociality bleeds over into offline life (van Dijck 2013, 19).\n\nFrom Internet memes and the Occupy Wall Street movement, Twitter hashtags and climate change protests, and political messages spread through Facebook and voting behaviors, online actions are intertwined in a complex ecology of activism. This complex ecology of activism includes offline actions, the actions of one’s friends and personal network, and non-human influencers such as tweets, memes, and status posts (Milner 2013; Segerberg and Bennett 2011; Bond et al. 2012). When considering the impact of social media on policy, institutions and organizations must attend to both the power of influencers in the network and the power of the meme itself to tap into a collective social consciousness. Without harnessing the power of influencers in the network, online activism may not spread rapidly or as far as it will when championed by these individuals. And without creating online campaigns that tap into people’s emotional or cultural ties, online activism may similarly fail to gain a foothold. The HRC logo illustrates the powerful potential that can occur when campaigns tap into emotional foundations of a collective and rely on the ability of both influencers and everyday individuals within large-scale networks.\n\n# References\n\n“About Our Logo.” Human Rights Campaign. 2011.

First developed as a ghost story-telling game, and then converted into an open-source, free-to-share system, PolyXpress is now being tested in an ethnic studies memory project about settler and native communities along the California Central Coast, and in a storytelling project in Brisbane, Australia in collaboration with the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The PolyXpress project has three goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Discover an effective method for capturing, and presenting, location-based stories for internal and public use by underrepresented communities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create a free-to-share, public software system for storytellers that requires only basic web browsing skills to use.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Build an international, academic and community-focused network of development partners to collaboratively expand, refine, and strengthen the PolyXpress system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_EriT28VP8aDK6bQgvNqmbQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_r8fc8ue3vxXqX77YBn1TXw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_rxxkSGuN0gVTM0bi92K4wg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"project-foundation\">Project Foundation</h1>\n<p>The uncelebrated and casual stories of marginalized communities all around us often remain hidden from public view due to a lack of resources and access to easy-to-use technology to capture and present these stories. The time, money, and effort required for the creation of a location-based storytelling system for a museum or large public venue limit which stories are captured, built, and presented (Hansen 2012) . Innovative story design, creative play, continual revision and the iterative adaptation of story to environment and user are rarely supported; as a result well-trodden, simplistic “official” public narratives are privileged.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; By making PolyXpress free and simple to use for academics, students, and community storytellers, we hope to provide under-represented communities with an effective, adaptive technology to tell their histories.</p>\n<p>In the process, we also hope to deepen the understanding of local histories, and discover new forms of effective place-based narrative (Tebeau 2013). In tying digital storytelling to geography, PolyXpress provides an opportunity to study how geolocational technology can augment and thereby influence a community’s knowledge of place (Valk 2013) .</p>\n<h1 id=\"iteration-1-polyghost--frank-aston-archival-display-january-april-2012\">Iteration #1: PolyGhost &amp; Frank Aston Archival Display: January-April, 2012</h1>\n<p>The PolyXpress development process began with an art and history archival show at Cal Poly’s Robert E. Kennedy Library presenting the work of Frank Aston, an early 1900s California photographer. The LAES program created location-centered ghost stories (scattered around campus) based on the archive photos, supplemented by voice recordings, soundscapes, fabricated newspaper stories, and journal entries. The stories were presented through a LAES-purpose-built, geolocational iPhone story application called PolyGhost.</p>\n<h1 id=\"iteration-2-polyxpress--california-middle-school-walkthrough-october-2013\">Iteration #2: PolyXpress &amp; California Middle School Walkthrough: October, 2013</h1>\n<p>To provide for wider system access, the PolyGhost iPhone application was rewritten as an HTML5 web application, renamed PolyXpress, then used for a walkthrough, interactive story experience for a California middle school. This system iteration placed participants in the role of concerned citizens using scientific methods to determine if space aliens were behind a series of mysterious incidents on school grounds.</p>\n<h1 id=\"iteration-3-polyxpress--brisbane-australia-walkthrough-april-may-2014\">Iteration #3: PolyXpress &amp; Brisbane, Australia Walkthrough: April-May, 2014</h1>\n<p>An Australian development team (led by Dr. David Gillette) composed of undergraduate students and QUT design faculty ran the first field tests of PolyXpress in a large urban environment. The team collaborated with the director of a local aboriginal arts festival to knit together stories about the land under the current urban infrastructure of Brisbane. The goal of these stories was to help users see and hear (through different media) how the area may have appeared to the original aboriginal inhabitants, and to reveal other changes to the landscape over time. Comments from the Australian PolyXpress site testers, plus technical usability reports from the QUT student development teams were complied into recommendations that guided the next field tests run in California weeks later.</p>\n<h1 id=\"iteration-4-polyxpress--pismo-beach-california-walkthrough-may-june-2014\">Iteration #4: PolyXpress &amp; Pismo Beach, California Walkthrough: May-June, 2014</h1>\n<p>PolyXpress was used to curate stories and digital assets made available through the Re/Collecting Project at Cal Poly (Re/Co), a digital-only memory project of under-documented communities of California’s Central Coast. Re/Co makes its archive available through Omeka, an open-source web-publishing platform for collections based research developed by Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. Cal Poly faculty, staff, and students worked with local community members to record and digitize their stories and story materials, assets that often cannot be found in any institutional repository. With collected research materials, the PolyXpress team studied Pismo Beach, California as a palimpsest: a narrative surface and a geographical structure that hints at nearly erased layers of community and place-based histories (Dourish 2007). As a part of Re/Co, ethnic studies students went into the field to research, digitize, and record stories and story materials from the local community. LAES students adapted the stories from this Pismo Beach project to be presented through the PolyXpress system. Since many of the stories in Re/Co intimately tied to place and because its archive is already online, Re/Co assets, and Omeka assets generally, have proven to be a good fit for PolyXpress. The current questions the PolyXpress project explores are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>How do natural and built geographies shape the migration, settlement, and uprooting of the diverse communities that move across them?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What physical reminders hint at past stories and how can technology augment how we bear witness to those pasts?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can multi-vocal narratives of a place inform and possibly transform its future?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can PolyXpress better serve as an open-source, collaborative platform for widespread, community-driven ethnographic research?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the main service-learning component for project-based hybrid arts and engineering courses at Cal Poly, the PolyXpress teams have focused on rapidly cycling through design and testing iterations to build toward a stable beta stage that will support future widespread testing and use. The research questions for the project are equally evolving and refining their focus, and the team continues to expand with the addition of new research and development partners.

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaefce172290686e460d98"},"enabled":true,"title":"The 2016 Salzburg Academy on Media & Global Change: Media, Migration & the Civic Imagination\n","body":{"html":"<p>By Paul Mihailidis</p>\n<p>&gt; “We cannot change the world unless we imagine what a better world might look like.”</p>\n<p>&gt; — Henry Jenkins (2016)</p>\n<p>This summer’s 10th <a href=\"http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/\">Salzburg Academy on Media &amp; Global Change</a> will focus on the topic of migration — an issue that affects communities around the world. We will explore how global narratives about migration are constructed and how personal stories can drive intercultural dialogue.</p>\n<p>For millennia, the journey of human migration across and inside borders has radically altered how humans connect. But what is unique about global migration flow in the present are the digital and social technologies and tools that are changing how humans can connect. Cross-media platforms, social networks and digital technologies are altering how information is consumed, produced, expressed and shared — and in ever more open, diverse, and collaborative ways. This shift has led to new opportunities and challenges for how the stories of migration can be told, shared, retold — as well as suppressed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_y0bXNu8oz5yO4H2h.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Despite today’s advances in multi-platform storytelling tools, media and news organizations are struggling to tell deep stories of migration that meaningfully elaborate on how both home and away communities are impacted. Not all the news stories of migration are narratives that address key concerns of inclusion and diversity — or that call readers, listeners and viewers to critical reflection. Too often coverage trafficks in generalizations and faceless data, emphasizes stereotypes, and perpetuates the notion of migrants and refugees as being “different” from — and threatening to — those in the media’s audience.</p>\n<p>To explore these narratives, we are going to gather 74 students from over 25 nationalities, and 19 faculty and 16 guest scholars from over 15 nationalities, to explore the relationship between media and narratives of migration in digital culture, and to build collaborative multimedia essays that will present diverse and dynamic ways to connect humans in the hopes of overcoming intolerance, stereotyping and reductionist narratives associated with global migration.</p>\n<p>To help frame our inquiry, Seminal media scholar Henry Jenkins and his team from USC will be joining us to provide a series of seminars and workshops on the concept of civic imagination.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-civic-imagination\">The Civic Imagination</h1>\n<p>Civic imagination is the capacity to imagine alternatives to current social, political, or economic conditions; one cannot change the world unless one can imagine what a better world might look like.</p>\n<p>Too often, our focus on contemporary problems makes it impossible to see beyond immediate constraints. This tunnel vision perpetuates the status quo, and innovative voices and action from the margin — especially youth — are ignored or deemed inconsequential. As writers like Shakuntala Banaji and David Buckingham (2013) have suggested, young people are often excluded from playing an “actual” or “meaningful” role in the processes associated with institutionalized politics, their agendas are marginalized, and they are disenfranchised.</p>\n<p>Through our own research on young activists, we’ve found that young people are learning to identify and frame political issues in language that speaks to them and their peers. Many of the youth we interview tell us that they felt discomfort embracing contemporary political rhetoric that speaks neither to or about their concerns. While young adults arguably have more opportunities for political engagement than ever, the mechanisms for this engagement are often outdated and rely on antiquated power structures that confuse “voice” for “action.” Seeking to move the needle on their own terms, youth are looking beyond traditional political constructions and embracing imagery and stories framed through media.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_25Jb6o2tY9iA9faY.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In turning toward icons and narratives borrowed from popular media to express their civic identities and political concerns, youth are seeking a way to bridge divisions and differences that make it hard for traditional political institutions to move forward to solve persistent problems. This tactic is not new: groups seeking change have long referenced the cultural image bank to shift civic imagination. Consider the following examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The American civil rights movement in the 1950s used the rhetoric of the black church and spoke of the need to “cross the River Jordan” and enter the “promised land.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Indian independence movement in the early twentieth century drew on ancient Hindu myths to build a case for ending colonial rule.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Pro-democracy protesters in Czechoslovakia appropriated Czech fairy tales as they literally jiggled their keys to “ring in” the end of the Communist era in 1989.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today’s generation of young activists maintains a strong relationship to popular culture, and that cultural vocabulary can help broker relations across different political groups. Youths across the globe are remixing popular culture for political ends. The creative energies of citizens are being joined with the political commitments of activists. This movement from the private/elite towards the public/democratized imagination often draws on images already familiar to participants from other contexts — images drawn not from political rhetoric but popular fantasy. Consider these two cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The immigration reform movement in the United States has taken up Superman, a superhero whose legal status of citizenship remains unclear (he IS from the planet Krypton), as a central symbol.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rang De Basanti, a Bollywood film whose plot centrally involves young people’s struggle for social justice, inspired a real world protest that emulated the film in both method (sit-ins at the India Gate in Delhi) and cause (both protested high-level government corruption) in ways that actually helped produce tangible results.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"process-and-approach\">Process and Approach</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Gcs6UmRa-O0iOHWV.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The Academy will use this frame to first explore how personal and communities narratives impact our worldviews, and the commonalities and differences that exist among our group in Salzburg. We’ll then see how our narratives connect — and disconnect — to large media coverage of migration. Finally, we’ll produce multimedia essays that discuss how we can leverage the power of human narratives, our civic imagination and digital media to reimagine narratives of migration. The scope of exploration at the Academy looks as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Exploring the Personal and Community</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exploring How Media Portrays Migration</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Connecting Narratives</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Building a Multimedia Story</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Human Connections &amp; Human Reflections</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To guide our participants in this exploration, our curriculum is anchored by seminars, workshops, reading groups, screenings, and beyond, that provide diverse and rigorous content and context for explore media and migration. Topics will include: Data Visualization, Game Design, Mobile Storytelling, Civic Media Activism, and more.</p>\n<p>Lastly, A public workshop on Civic Media &amp; Migration will be jointly convened with the Institute for Auslandsbeziehungen (IFA). Participants will include policy experts, media capacity organizations, community stakeholders, faculty working in media and communication fields, and young media makers engaging in media work across cultures. Participants will share in the findings of the research and brainstorm ways to employ media literacy as a constructive tool for civic dialog, policy making and media messaging today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_PCvSfczkN5zAvp_V.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>To read more about the 2016 Academy program, visit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.salzburgglobal.org/calendar/2010-2019/2016/sac-10.html\">http://www.salzburgglobal.org/calendar/2010-2019/2016/sac-10.html</a></p>\n<p>For more information or inquiries, contact Paul Mihailidis: <a href=\"mailto:paul@elab.emerson.edu\">paul@elab.emerson.edu</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"2016-participating-faculty\">2016 Participating Faculty</h3>\n<p>Paul Mihailidis, Emerson College (Program Director)\nSusan Moeller, University of Maryland\nHenry Jenkins, USC Annenberg\nStephen Salyer, Salzburg Global Seminar\nJad Melki, Lebanese American University\nMegan Fromm, Colorado Mesa University\nRoman Gerodimos, Bournemouth University, UK\nChris Harris, Nevada State College\nEric Gordon, Emerson College / Berkman Center, Harvard\nStephen Reese, University of Texas, Austin\nNick Diakopolous, University of Maryland, College Park\nCecilia Balbin, Catholic University Argentina\nEwald Volk, St. Poelten University, Vienna, Austria\nManuel Guerrero, Iberoamericana University, Mexico\nSangita Shrsethova, USC Annenberg\nPablo Martinez, Iberoamericana University, Mexico\nLuis Miguel, Iberoamericana University, Mexico\nGabriel Peters-Lazaro, USC Cinema Schools\nDaphne Wales, University of Rhode Island</p>\n<h3 id=\"2016-guest-scholars\">2016 Guest Scholars</h3>\n<p>Sanjeev Chatterjee, University of Miami\nAmy Ansell, Dean of Liberal Arts, Emerson College\nCatherine D’Ignazio, MIT Media Lab\nMoses Shumow, Florida International University\nKaren Fowler Watts, Bournemouth University, UK\nJusteen Hyde, Institute for Community Health, Cambridge, MA\nAnthony Ioannidis, IASquare\nSteve Jukes, Bournemouth University, UK\nTadzio MacGregor, freelance journalist\nDave McEvoy, Appalachian State University\nCarol Reese, Eanes Independent School District in Austin, Texas\nOlga Škvareninová, St. Cyril and Methodius, Slovakia\nOdila Triebel, Institute for Auslandsbeziehungen, Germany\nPeter Webinger — Austrian Minister of the Interior\nMichaele Whalen, Provost, Emerson College\nSarah Widmaier, Institute for Auslandsbeziehungen, Germany</p>\n<h3 id=\"2016-core-staff\">2016 Core Staff</h3>\n<p>Clare Shine, Chief Program Officer, Salzburg Global Seminar\nBeth Pertiller, Director of Operations, Salzburg Global Seminar\nKevin Kolesnikoff, Program Associate, Salzburg Global Seminar\nJordan Pailthorpe, Creative Producer, Engagement Lab</p>\n","md":"\nBy Paul Mihailidis\n\n&gt; “We cannot change the world unless we imagine what a better world might look like.”\n\n&gt; — Henry Jenkins (2016)\n\nThis summer’s 10th [Salzburg Academy on Media &amp; Global Change](http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/) will focus on the topic of migration — an issue that affects communities around the world.

Some of them have played a largely peripheral role in the formal political arena. Others have been successful — to varying degrees — in gaining widespread public support and, in some cases, generating change by influencing actions of policymakers and other political elites. A large volume of scholarly work across academic disciplines has investigated different facets of these protest initiatives (see examples <a href=\"http://pol.sagepub.com/content/35/2/151.short\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ccaeb637-2669-4980-8726-f719cd3ac925%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/amet.12112/full\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12074/full\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1161817\">here</a>). Particularly, the bulk of these studies has focused on dynamics of protest related to political, social, and economic matters. Little to no attention has been given to the role played by culture in shaping patterns of political and civic engagement in the digital media environment. Through a <a href=\"http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx\">SSHRC</a>-funded <a href=\"https://t.co/RcEaduOHPM\">study</a>, we are currently addressing this gap in the literature. It takes a specific look at how references to culture informed Twitter-based grassroots political engagement in the context of the Idle No More (INM) movement in Canada.</p>\n<p>INM, which emerged in November 2012, can be defined as an Indigenous-led protest initiative that mobilized Indigenous Peoples and their allies throughout Canada — and later internationally — in the wake of several legislative measures introduced by the Stephen Harper’s conservative government. Chief among them was the federal omnibus budget <a href=\"http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=5942521\">bill C-45</a>, which imposed significant changes to the Indian Act, environmental legislation, and other policy initiatives of importance to Indigenous communities (for more information, see works by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FXOeBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=Idle+No+More&amp;ots=47usWalWvA&amp;sig=q9UWW-BKQqXS0xcUss_dVS-wyQw#v=onepage&amp;q=Idle%20No%20More&amp;f=false\">Duplassie</a>, <a href=\"http://jsse.org/index.php/jsse/article/download/1354/1456\">Tupper</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alternative.ac.nz/sites/default/files/AlterNative%20Sample%20Commentary.pdf\">Woons</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/107/85\">Wotherspoon &amp; Hansen</a>). As the movement intensified over the following weeks, it received increased mass media coverage and became more diverse, as it mobilized individuals and organizations with narrow <a href=\"http://arpbooks.org/books/detail/the-winter-we-danced\">interests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/107/85\">objectives</a>. More importantly for this study, social media became go-to tools for individuals and organizations to engage in political and civic action, whether it was in support of or in opposition to INM (see examples <a href=\"http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6e597b7c-654c-48b9-89ee-e160d47be058%40sessionmgr101&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://jsse.org/index.php/jsse/article/download/1354/1456\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/107/85\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>As supported by the work of <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/35470\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.alternative.ac.nz/sites/default/files/AlterNative%20Sample%20Commentary.pdf\">authors</a>, Indigenous culture and identity have played a pivotal role in this process. For example, Welty <a href=\"\">points out</a> that culture can be viewed as an important driver of INM-related mobilizing and organizing. Defining Indigenous culture is challenging, however, as it can vary greatly between and within communities. Instead of providing a fixed or single definition, we identify indicators of Indigenous culture. Building on a <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/42993/summary\">model</a> developed by Holms, Pearson et al. and <a href=\"http://web.uvic.ca/igov/uploads/pdf/Being%20Indigenous%20GOOP.pdf\">later work</a> by Alfred and Corntassel (2005), we isolate core elements of Indigenous culture, namely “epistemologies,” “language,” “land,” “cultural production,” as well as local, regional, national, and transnational “group membership.” Following Coulthard’s <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/35470\">work</a>, we add to this list “resistance” against colonialism, which has also been at the heart of Indigenous Peoples’ ideology.</p>\n<p>A systematic review of 1,650 tweets with at least one #IdleNoMore hashtag that appeared on Twitter’s public timeline between July 3, 2013 and August 2, 2013 revealed that references to core elements of Indigenous culture permeated all aspects of INM-related political and civic action in the Twitterverse. They were prevalent in a large majority of the #IdleNoMore tweets considered for our study, whether they served an information dispersion function, a public mobilization function, an opinion sharing function, or a political attack or criticism function. We posit references to Indigenous culture were used to foster and reinforce a shared consciousness that helped fuel protest behavior. In other words, cultural references in tweets both broadened audiences and strengthened Indigenous communities online. This form of culture-based political protest is particularly well suited for social media as it encourages hyper-personal self-expression in a highly networked digital environment.</p>\n<p>More research is needed to unpack the role of culture as a tool for marginalized political, social, and religious groups to engage in political and civic action in the social mediascape. Of special importance would be the study of how this highly cultural form of political engagement is leading to identity formation or reinforcement. It could also have some effects on policy making as governments are likely to become increasingly responsive to social media-based protest movements over the next decade.</p>\n<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>The authors of this blog post would like to thank the <a href=\"https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHlIPBi5jOAhXqLsAKHRLOC_UQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca%2Fhome-accueil-eng.aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCv4YDjOxfiH1OseWuuVcxsQKARw&amp;bvm=bv.128617741,d.bGg\">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council</a> for a research grant that supported the work for this blog post.

More importantly for this study, social media became go-to tools for individuals and organizations to engage in political and civic action, whether it was in support of or in opposition to INM (see examples [here](http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6e597b7c-654c-48b9-89ee-e160d47be058%40sessionmgr101&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=112), [here](http://jsse.org/index.php/jsse/article/download/1354/1456), and [here](http://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/107/85)).\n\nAs supported by the work of [several](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/35470) [authors](http://www.alternative.ac.nz/sites/default/files/AlterNative%20Sample%20Commentary.pdf), Indigenous culture and identity have played a pivotal role in this process. For example, Welty [points out]() that culture can be viewed as an important driver of INM-related mobilizing and organizing. Defining Indigenous culture is challenging, however, as it can vary greatly between and within communities. Instead of providing a fixed or single definition, we identify indicators of Indigenous culture. Building on a [model](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/42993/summary) developed by Holms, Pearson et al. and [later work](http://web.uvic.ca/igov/uploads/pdf/Being%20Indigenous%20GOOP.pdf) by Alfred and Corntassel (2005), we isolate core elements of Indigenous culture, namely “epistemologies,” “language,” “land,” “cultural production,” as well as local, regional, national, and transnational “group membership.” Following Coulthard’s [work](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/35470), we add to this list “resistance” against colonialism, which has also been at the heart of Indigenous Peoples’ ideology.\n\nA systematic review of 1,650 tweets with at least one #IdleNoMore hashtag that appeared on Twitter’s public timeline between July 3, 2013 and August 2, 2013 revealed that references to core elements of Indigenous culture permeated all aspects of INM-related political and civic action in the Twitterverse. They were prevalent in a large majority of the #IdleNoMore tweets considered for our study, whether they served an information dispersion function, a public mobilization function, an opinion sharing function, or a political attack or criticism function. We posit references to Indigenous culture were used to foster and reinforce a shared consciousness that helped fuel protest behavior. In other words, cultural references in tweets both broadened audiences and strengthened Indigenous communities online. This form of culture-based political protest is particularly well suited for social media as it encourages hyper-personal self-expression in a highly networked digital environment.\n\nMore research is needed to unpack the role of culture as a tool for marginalized political, social, and religious groups to engage in political and civic action in the social mediascape. Of special importance would be the study of how this highly cultural form of political engagement is leading to identity formation or reinforcement. It could also have some effects on policy making as governments are likely to become increasingly responsive to social media-based protest movements over the next decade.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**\n\nThe authors of this blog post would like to thank the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHlIPBi5jOAhXqLsAKHRLOC_UQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca%2Fhome-accueil-eng.aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCv4YDjOxfiH1OseWuuVcxsQKARw&amp;bvm=bv.128617741,d.bGg) for a research grant that supported the work for this blog post.

Emphasizing the model of co-production, where citizens collaborate at all stages of decision-making on public issues, the Roadmap balances digital and in-person strategies to help practitioners navigate the ever-shifting landscape of engagement in the 21st Century.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_YTGlvKVBhlV5HU_4_8i3hQ.png)\n\nThe Roadmap is based on practical findings summarized in [\\*Accelerating Public Engagement](https://engage.livingcities.org/guide),\\* a report written by **Eric Gordon**, Executive Director of the Engagement Lab and Associate Professor at Emerson College, about real-life examples from public engagement during the second cohort of Living Cities’ [City Accelerator](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/participation-and-engagement/public-engagement-city-accelerator) program. Over the course of 18-months, Gordon and the Engagement Lab team provided technical assistance and guidance to city officials in the program from Albuquerque, Atlanta, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Seattle as they implemented projects to engage lower income residents on issues ranging from post-incarceration re-entry services to public health campaigns.\n\n“The roadmap is a story of what it takes for organizations to actually partner with communities, well beyond checking the box,” said Eric Gordon. “Its focus is on creative methods, where relationships are put before efficiencies. Understanding how to use media and technology to enhance the human part of public engagement is more important now than ever before. That’s the focus of the report, and indeed, that’s the focus of all the Engagement Lab’s work.”\n\nIn all, the Roadmap comprises four resources grounded in design-thinking to help organizations map meaningful public engagement:\n\n-   The [Toolkit](https://engage.livingcities.org/toolkit), a dynamic, online assessment that helps gauge where you are with your plan, what your plan’s strengths are, and where you might benefit from some additional guidance, and then gets you started with a series of strategic exercises and practical activities to improve your engagement plan.\n\n-   The [Guide](https://engage.livingcities.org/guide), a comprehensive report called, _Accelerating Public Engagement,_ which provides background on public engagement and offers practical, detailed approaches to use when planning on- and offline processes.\n\n-   The[ Case Studies](https://engage.livingcities.org/case-studies), a closer look at the stories from participant cities in the City Accelerator program and how they embraced the model of co-production to discover new ways to engage more deeply with the communities they serve.\n\n-   The [Game](https://engage.livingcities.org/game), a tabletop game called, “Chart the Course” that guides players through an entire public engagement planning process and gives teams an opportunity to explore different engagement tactics, role-play possible outcomes with stakeholders, and reflect on the implications of their actions.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_tTG8_Qe2Odm6_ejDef4aCQ.png)\n\n“This Roadmap is intended for cities around the country who recognize that the solutions for today’s toughest problems aren’t found in some hidden corner of city hall,” [wrote](http://www.governing.com/cityaccelerator/blog/what-it-means-to-get-engaged-a-roadmap-for-cities.html) **Ben Hecht,** President and CEO of Living Cities, “but rather are co-developed through partnerships with residents, community colleges and universities, nonprofits, philanthropic organizations, and the business community.”\n\nExplore the Public Engagement Roadmap [here](https://engage.livingcities.org/), and learn more about the work of the City Accelerator program [here](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/participation-and-engagement/public-engagement-city-accelerator).

Whether it’s used in classrooms, conferences, strategic board meetings, or public events, @Stake helps players understand how productive conversations thrive with authentic listening and diverse perspectives.</p>\n<p>Even when all sides have the best intentions, civic or political issues often involve conflicting interests coupled with deep resentments and community divides. Building a new highway, for example, is seldom only a question of the highway’s design, but the future of the land, the community, and individual residents.</p>\n<p>With @Stake for mobile, players are provided a deeper understanding of community needs by considering different perspectives before making decisions. In the game, 3–5 players introduce their character’s perspectives, jump into think mode to invent creative solutions to the issue being discussed, and take turns proposing their ideas and arguing for their character’s point of view, complete with secret agendas. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins and retains bragging rights as “best deliberator!”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_vCCoeSjjkR_ljkIc.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>@Stake began as a tabletop <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/participation-and-engagement/atstake\">card game</a> in 2013 to facilitate conversations about youth unemployment in Moldova with the UNDP. Since then, it has been used in a number of workshops and conferences all over the world. After increased demand for the game and a research study with the Participatory Budgeting Project, the Engagement Lab received a <a href=\"https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/stake-to-receive-knight-prototype-fund-grant-7d9e68654250\">Knight Foundation prototype grant in 2015</a> to make a mobile version.

Whether it’s used in classrooms, conferences, strategic board meetings, or public events, @Stake helps players understand how productive conversations thrive with authentic listening and diverse perspectives.\n\nEven when all sides have the best intentions, civic or political issues often involve conflicting interests coupled with deep resentments and community divides. Building a new highway, for example, is seldom only a question of the highway’s design, but the future of the land, the community, and individual residents.\n\nWith @Stake for mobile, players are provided a deeper understanding of community needs by considering different perspectives before making decisions. In the game, 3–5 players introduce their character’s perspectives, jump into think mode to invent creative solutions to the issue being discussed, and take turns proposing their ideas and arguing for their character’s point of view, complete with secret agendas. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins and retains bragging rights as “best deliberator!”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_vCCoeSjjkR_ljkIc.png)\n\n@Stake began as a tabletop [card game](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/participation-and-engagement/atstake) in 2013 to facilitate conversations about youth unemployment in Moldova with the UNDP. Since then, it has been used in a number of workshops and conferences all over the world. After increased demand for the game and a research study with the Participatory Budgeting Project, the Engagement Lab received a [Knight Foundation prototype grant in 2015](https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/stake-to-receive-knight-prototype-fund-grant-7d9e68654250) to make a mobile version. The resulting mobile game synthesizes and streamlines the card game experience to make it easier and more immediately playable.\n\n“@Stake is a simple, and free, tool that helps groups of people deliberate about complex issues.

The students conducted a survey to learn about attitudes on climate change in Roxbury. They meanwhile investigated the impact of increasing heat on Roxbury’s elderly population, and proposed solutions to the crisis, including increasing green space and reducing parking lot sizes, providing public cooling centers, and creating a system for neighbors checking on neighbors.\n\n![Students from the Climate Change and Society class at Northeastern](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_7LlmcrtX7zRxaPqRLbjbYQ.jpeg)\n\nSara Wylie’s class on Community Research Methods at Northeastern explored environmental data justice, which “recognizes the power and politics associated with the production, storage and dissemination of environmental data.” The students partnered with [GreenRoots Chelsea](http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/), and found disturbing inaccuracies between federally reported data and reality, and also staged data performances in public that made visible the pollutants in the Mystic River near Chelsea.\n\n![Panel on climate change action in Boston](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_fMe5Xiyv10CEXhqBJzH6yw.jpeg)\n\nAfter the student showcase, a panel of local leaders in climate change — including **Muge Undermir** of Greenovate, **Andrew McFarland** of LivableStreets Alliance, **Maureen White** of GoBoston 2030 and **Carolyn Day** of Ellenzweig—responded to the student projects and discussed the role of cities like Boston in leading climate change action.\n\nThe panelists discussed their own roles in confronting climate change and offered encouragement for the students in attendance who want to take action. Andrew McFarland prodded students to reach out to their university administrators who are big stakeholders in the city. Muge Undemir coaxed students to contact their public officials to express their thoughts and ideas on climate change action, because as Muge said, “we are listening!”\n\nNext semester, another BCM cohort will take on climate change at four Boston universities, with classes focusing on Climate Change, Games and Social Change, Data Visualization, Data Storytelling, Art and Ecology and Community Practice.

During her time at Merrimack, she developed and co-founded WMCK, the college’s first ever student run radio station using experience she gained from WUML at the University of Massachusetts Lowell before landing at Merrimack. Following graduation, she was hired to manage and train the station’s new staff of over fifty student DJs, including many who had never had a radio show before. She is interested in how young people engage with mass media and how they can be encouraged to become involved in their communities using new media technologies that have become part of our daily lives. College radio helped her find her voice years ago and she seeks to help other people find their voices using mass media. Prior to entering the CMAP program, she worked in corporate security for a major US airline and spent time working at multiple Boston area radio stations. She also taught her two Australian Shepherds how to give high fives.*</p>\n<p><strong>What was the path that brought you to CMAP?</strong>\nI became fascinated by the ways in which people engage with technology when I got a job at Apple in 2011. I also studied communication in undergrad and spent a lot of time working in radio and the music industry while in college. I had the wonderful opportunity to start a college radio station in 2014 and saw the impact it had on the campus community. When I left that position for my first real job at a very large corporation, I felt like a cog in a huge, impersonal machine. I wanted to advance my education as well as find a way to make an impact and contribute to the lives of others at the same time. I was also interested in further exploring our deep and complex relationships with technology and innovation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Y1_rWk9dpOe5Bu8uLSu1Fg.jpeg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Anna Ladd\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; I wanted to advance my education as well as find a way to make an impact and contribute to the lives of others at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>What does civic media mean to you?</strong>\nTo me, civic media is all about how we can leverage the innovative technologies we use every day to create and sustain positive social change and become more effective and engaged citizens of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>What is one change you would like to see in the world?</strong>\nMore engaged listening, empathy and consideration for the experiences of others.</p>\n<p>*<em>What would you want the civic media community to know about you?\n*</em>I’m interested to know how some of the research that has been happening in this space around engagement and participatory culture is being implemented, especially amongst young people in educational contexts. I think young people have a lot to say that society largely brushes off due to their relationships with social media, but I wonder how we can engage with the worlds that they’re creating.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’ve done in the past that intersect with your studies now?</strong>\nI once took an intercultural communication class and got to do a short study on racial makeups of concert lineups, which led me to understanding some of the cultural issues that we get to study on a larger scale in this program. I also did a short study on social media use and mental health in undergraduate students which is highly relevant to this program. Starting a radio station also taught me a lot about leadership, organizational design and participant engagement, all of which I get to learn about on a larger scale now.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gVlPSs12biw2YGUl3B8HrQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Aakanksha Gupta\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do you define engagement?

She is interested in how young people engage with mass media and how they can be encouraged to become involved in their communities using new media technologies that have become part of our daily lives. College radio helped her find her voice years ago and she seeks to help other people find their voices using mass media. Prior to entering the CMAP program, she worked in corporate security for a major US airline and spent time working at multiple Boston area radio stations. She also taught her two Australian Shepherds how to give high fives.\\*\n\n**What was the path that brought you to CMAP?**\nI became fascinated by the ways in which people engage with technology when I got a job at Apple in 2011. I also studied communication in undergrad and spent a lot of time working in radio and the music industry while in college. I had the wonderful opportunity to start a college radio station in 2014 and saw the impact it had on the campus community. When I left that position for my first real job at a very large corporation, I felt like a cog in a huge, impersonal machine. I wanted to advance my education as well as find a way to make an impact and contribute to the lives of others at the same time. I was also interested in further exploring our deep and complex relationships with technology and innovation.\n\n![Photo credit: Anna Ladd](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Y1_rWk9dpOe5Bu8uLSu1Fg.jpeg)\n\n&gt; &gt; I wanted to advance my education as well as find a way to make an impact and contribute to the lives of others at the same time.\n\n**What does civic media mean to you?**\nTo me, civic media is all about how we can leverage the innovative technologies we use every day to create and sustain positive social change and become more effective and engaged citizens of the world.\n\n**What is one change you would like to see in the world?**\nMore engaged listening, empathy and consideration for the experiences of others.\n\n**What would you want the civic media community to know about you?\n**I’m interested to know how some of the research that has been happening in this space around engagement and participatory culture is being implemented, especially amongst young people in educational contexts. I think young people have a lot to say that society largely brushes off due to their relationships with social media, but I wonder how we can engage with the worlds that they’re creating.\n\n**Are there any specific projects that you’ve done in the past that intersect with your studies now?**\nI once took an intercultural communication class and got to do a short study on racial makeups of concert lineups, which led me to understanding some of the cultural issues that we get to study on a larger scale in this program. I also did a short study on social media use and mental health in undergraduate students which is highly relevant to this program. Starting a radio station also taught me a lot about leadership, organizational design and participant engagement, all of which I get to learn about on a larger scale now.\n\n![Photo credit: Aakanksha Gupta](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_gVlPSs12biw2YGUl3B8HrQ.jpeg)\n\n**How do you define engagement? What does being engaged mean to you?** Engagement is all about being an active participant. It’s hard to be engaged in something you passively consume, but showing up and being present and ready to listen and contribute are key to engagement. Listening is great, but it’s not really enough.\n\n**What are some of your favorite pieces of media?\n**All time favorites are hard but here are my favorites lately: Music: _War Elephant_ by **Deer Tick** and _Doris_ by **Earl Sweatshirt**.\n\nBooks: _Too Much and Not the Mood_ by **Durga Chew-Bose** and _Good Booty_ by **Ann Powers**.\n\nTelevision: This summer I started watching _Grey’s Anatomy_ for the first time, which was a trip. The first couple of seasons feature some intense and compelling writing.\n\n**What’s one fun fact most people don’t know about you?\n**I have a running list of celebrities who have yelled at me in various customer service contexts.\n\n_Learn more about [Civic Media, Art &amp; Practice](https://elab.emerson.edu/cmap)._\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2018-01-09T05:00:00Z"},"key":"cmap-student-spotlight-lindsy-goldberg-2017-18-cohort","__v":0}

It isn’t enough to be right about the world you want to live in. You gotta sell it, even to those you fear.”</em></p>\n<p>He spoke of the overwhelming power of three illusions that blind even the most well-meaning of us from effecting the kind of change we seek.</p>\n<p><strong>Systems, not starfish</strong>. By focusing on the difference we make on those we choose to help, we risk avoiding the deeper, more systemic causes of societal ill. We often do this because the deeper problems implicate powerful people or even ourselves. But real change requires addressing the systems, structures, institutions, and privileges that protect the status quo — a much harder thing to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing people.</strong> By sitting in our own sense of what is right in the world, without actively trying to persuade those who do not believe in our visions, we also relinquish transformative change. “The woke have a choice about how to deal with the ambivalent. Do you focus on building a fortress to protect yourselves from them? Or a road to help them cross the mountain?” Anand argues that real change requires “expanding the circle,” and that implies a meaningful engagement across lines of difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Rooting to place.</strong> Finally, by being a citizen of the globe, we risk being a citizen of no place, ignoring the honest reckoning that illuminates how systems actually affect everyday people’s lives — and perhaps our own responsibility for those outcomes, due to indifference or neglect. “When rooted, you observe how systems actually affect people,” says Anand. About President Obama’s own formative experiences in Chicago, Anand shared perhaps his most beautiful observation with us: “Raised a citizen of the world, he became a citizen of particular earth. Rooting put him on the path to leading the free world.”</p>\n<p>Anand’s piercing vision has illuminated my own work recently — in particular, working with a team of parents and innovators to catalyze an inclusive and intersectional movement in breastfeeding innovation.</p>\n<p>For over a year, with colleagues at Emerson Engagement Lab and the MIT Media Lab, I have been working to “<a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/\">Make the Breast Pump Not Suck</a>.” We’ve successfully raised money from the WK Kellogg Foundation, Medela, and others to seek answers to the following questions:</p>\n<p>&gt; <em>Why do so many people have such extreme negative experiences with breast pumping and attempting to breastfeed while working?</em></p>\n<p>&gt; <em>Why does it still suck so badly for so many people to meet basic public health goals in the United States?</em></p>\n<p>We have also made a commitment to do something with this information, hosting a hackathon to improve post-partum technologies (which we define as technologies that improve the lives of new parents) and a policy summit to address the other social, cultural, policy, and legislative reasons why many families are unable to give their kids the “<a href=\"https://www.wkkf.org/what-we-do/healthy-kids/first-food\">first food</a>” we know is best for them. We have assembled a <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/team/\">mind-blowingly amazing Advisory Board</a> to guide our path. We have also been working with the <a href=\"http://versededucationgroup.com/\">brilliant Jennifer Roberts of Versed Education Group</a> to ensure that equity and inclusion is meaningfully at the core of everything we do.</p>\n<p>A few weekends ago, we had the privilege of meeting <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/community/\">four teams of innovators across the US</a> who are doing deep and important work to support the parents in their communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheBirthSanctuaryBoston/\">Birth Sanctuary Boston</a> is working to create the only freestanding birth center in Dorchester, MA;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.harambeecare.org/\">Harambee Care</a> is developing a self-advocacy breastfeeding tool to increase lactation support and education in Detroit, MI;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.iwrising.org/\">Indigenous Women Rising</a> is developing breastfeeding-friendly traditional clothing for Apache and Pueblo breastfeeding parents in Albuquerque, NM; and</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NEMSBP/\">Northeast Mississippi Birthing Project</a> is training community health workers to focus majorly on birth and breastfeeding equity in Tupelo, MI. (This last group told me that they helped to bring <em>over 300 babies</em> into the world last year, all on time they volunteer to the parents in their communities.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These groups gathered with us at the MIT Media Lab to share work and skills, and to offer guidance on how our project should move forward. It is important to note that this group is, with one exception, all women of color. Our organizing team is, with two exceptions, all white women. I will touch on what this means for our work in a bit. We also had four babies present with us, contributing their own ideas and drinking down boob juice when needed. The youngest among us was 13 days old.</p>\n<p>Over the course of multiple conversations that weekend, it became apparent to me how Anand’s powerful illusions are at work in our own project — even in spite of our best intentions.</p>\n<p><strong>If you focus too much on the starfish, it’s easy to forget the systems.</strong></p>\n<p>In trying to answer the question “Why do so many people have such extreme negative experiences with breast pumping and attempting to breastfeed while working?” we had determined that we should gather the individual stories of parents, including their triumphs and challenges with breastfeeding. In our research, we plan to interview women who identify as low-income, women of color, and LGBTQIA parents — and the care providers that support them — because their experiences are not nearly as well-known as the experiences of white, well-educated women. What might we learn from their individual experiences that could be fixed through collaborative problem-solving?</p>\n<p>In talking with the leaders present at our workshop, it became clear that their interests expanded beyond this focus. They wanted to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why is it that the health facilities they work in treat their patients of color one way and their white patients another?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is it that when they share innovative improvements on breastfeeding care, their colleagues ignore them — but when their white peers take these ideas and offer them as their own, they are well-received?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is the senior lactation counselor (who is a woman of color) passed over for the top job when it becomes available and the position is offered to her less senior, white peer?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When those experiences force her to find a new institution, what are the impacts for the population of parents who were depending on her skills?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is it that care providers see their institutions making public commitments to “equity” and “diversity,” but not doing anything to change the practices, services, and attitudes at the level of care?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is it that particularly white women leaders in breastfeeding seem to have such a disproportionate impact on the discussions, decisions, and experiences of everybody else working the space?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is it that doctoral research on the indigenous and native breastfeeding experience is rejected for publication multiple times because there are not enough “peer-reviewed findings” to “substantiate” its claims?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is it that pump companies keep making products that are painful, inefficient, and not tailored to the needs and realities of low-income people? When we get a pump for free through our insurance, why is it inevitably <em>that</em>painful and inefficient pump?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These questions reinforce that our interviews with individual people need to be in service of identifying and dismantling points of failure in systems that do not serve parents and babies. The emphasis on institutions, history, and the powerful reality of racism in our daily lives needs to be front of mind, not something that we backfill later. We need to move beyond the deep-seated assumption that by focusing on the “user,” we will naturally come to understand the larger context that shapes that person’s experience. (This <a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/90149212/beyond-the-cult-of-human-centered-design?utm_content=buffer91e2f&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">piece in Wired</a> offers some useful frames for how to pair human-centered design with systems thinking.) If we fail to do this, then we reinforce the faulty notion that breastfeeding failings are the fault of individual parents, rather than the result of societal structures.</p>\n<p><strong>In attempting to change the experience of others, we should start with ourselves.</strong></p>\n<p>One of our main goals in doing this work is to ensure inclusive innovation — in other words, to ensure that traditional hacking and entrepreneurship in breastfeeding does not simply lead to more $1000 breast pumps for wealthy white women who have jobs that accommodate pumping and some version of paid family leave. In locating our hackathon and policy summit work at MIT, we want to go to the heart of that culture — working with and within an extremely powerful technology institution to define a new and more equitable way of innovating for social good. We have benefited in this work through our partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/graduate-program/diversity-community/\">Office of Diversity and Inclusion at the MIT Media Lab</a> and through plans to activate the Lab’s partnerships with HBCU’s so that student designers of color are present at the hackathon and policy summit. Jenn has been helping us implement the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@multiplyequity/racism-and-inequity-are-products-of-design-they-can-be-redesigned-12188363cc6a\">equityXdesign framework</a> that “merges the consciousness of racial equity work with the power of design methodologies.”</p>\n<p>And yet. Through our discussions this weekend, we saw that we had put the cart before the horse. In our aims to enact a kind of radical equity in tech entrepreneurship, we needed to first reexamine our own identities. What does it mean to be (mostly) white women organizing an effort to accomplish this goal? If we take a pause to examine our own identities, biases, stereotypes and assumptions, what might we see? Might we be better able to identify and deconstruct the elements of white supremacy and dominant culture that are silently baked into tech-everything if we start with how we ourselves are implicated? How would this analysis drive our decisions about how to use our own privilege to accomplish our goals? The white members of our organizing team have decided to engage in guided, regular discussion about our whiteness and its impacts moving forward.</p>\n<p>Engaging across difference remains an existential part of our goals, but before expanding the circle, as Anand says, we need to look within.</p>\n<p><strong>Our broader movement in breastfeeding innovation takes its very power from our local partners.</strong></p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, the gathered leaders shared stories — their own and others’ — of triumph in the face of great challenge and of poignant failure in spite of best attempts to breastfeed. Many of us are parents ourselves and there was more than one moment when tears formed, hearing these experiences and reliving our own.</p>\n<p>As we were debriefing how to use our privileges to ask powerful questions and develop answers that move people to action, we came again to Anand’s observation of the power of place. In our attempts to catalyze a national movement in breastfeeding innovation, it is really the local experience that will connect systems to people. It is by understanding how things are working — and not working — for parents in Tupelo and Boston and Detroit and Albuquerque that we’ll be able to identify the systems and institutions that need reform and demolishment across the country.</p>\n<p><em>“Look within, reach across, anchor down.”</em> This is Anand’s offering to each of us.

The white members of our organizing team have decided to engage in guided, regular discussion about our whiteness and its impacts moving forward.\n\nEngaging across difference remains an existential part of our goals, but before expanding the circle, as Anand says, we need to look within.\n\n**Our broader movement in breastfeeding innovation takes its very power from our local partners.**\n\nOver the course of the weekend, the gathered leaders shared stories — their own and others’ — of triumph in the face of great challenge and of poignant failure in spite of best attempts to breastfeed. Many of us are parents ourselves and there was more than one moment when tears formed, hearing these experiences and reliving our own.\n\nAs we were debriefing how to use our privileges to ask powerful questions and develop answers that move people to action, we came again to Anand’s observation of the power of place. In our attempts to catalyze a national movement in breastfeeding innovation, it is really the local experience that will connect systems to people. It is by understanding how things are working — and not working — for parents in Tupelo and Boston and Detroit and Albuquerque that we’ll be able to identify the systems and institutions that need reform and demolishment across the country.\n\n_“Look within, reach across, anchor down.”_ This is Anand’s offering to each of us. May we have the courage to practice it each day.\n\n_This post is cross-posted from [Kate Krontiris’ blog](https://www.katekrontiris.com/home/2017/11/9/look-within-reach-across-anchor-down-reflections-on-white-privilege-changemaking-and-moral-courage-in-the-age-of-magic-and-loss) on November 20th, 2017._\n\n# [Apply to participate](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/participate/) in the hackathon by February 28th and follow our work with #breastfeeding innovation.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2018-01-22T05:00:00Z"},"key":"look-within-reach-across-anchor-down","__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"62eaefdf172290686e460db1"},"enabled":true,"title":"Our Daughter’s Birth: The Seed of Gratefulness and Rage\n","body":{"html":"<p>By Kate Krontiris, Principal Investigator for <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/\"><em>Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon and Paid Family Leave Policy Summit</em></a></p>\n<p>When our daughter Nyaanina was born two years ago, she had a particularly intense form of jaundice that required her to be under special blue lights immediately. After three hours under the lights, we’d get her for barely 30 minutes, and then we would begrudgingly hand her back to the nurses to return under the lights. During those precious minutes holding this new, warm soul, I would do my best to get her to feed from the breast — a choice I was determined to stick with, over formula. Our doctors had told us that the only way for her to improve was to make her excrete as much as possible. Although many women don’t start using a breast pump until weeks after birth, I was hooked up to one on day two, so that we could ramp up my supply as rapidly as possible (or so I thought). I remember the lactation consultant at the hospital giving me a quick tutorial on the machine and handing me a bunch of syringes to collect the colostrum my breasts would produce.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_iIB-fy6Pc5GN4WWdoRGKsw.jpeg\" alt=\"We started calling Nina “Lieutenant NiSo” for her ability to soldier on through all of the feedings she underwent in those first few weeks. She moved up to General rank pretty quickly…\"></p>\n<p>Our process was this: I would attempt to feed her at the breast, then hand her over to her dad, who would try to keep her awake to drink another serving of pumped milk, while I then attached my body to the uncomfortable and noisy breast pump in order to produce her next dose of boob juice. I didn’t really understand how the machine worked, but I knew I was supposed to ramp up the suction to a certain level and then just let it stay on for a while. When we left the hospital after five days, we had to go through this process every 1.5 hours, around the clock, for a week — and then every 2–3 hours, around the clock, for a few weeks after that.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, my milk came in pretty quickly, but the crushing pumping routine led to an oversupply that overwhelmed my daughter’s ability to drink all the milk available. Trying to swallow from a veritable fire hose, she compensated with a latch that left my nipple cracked. I would cringe every time she attempted to feed on my injured side. I had heard people tell me “breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt” but that seemed both incorrect and also impractical. Breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt too badly is probably a more accurate statement — but for a first-time parent who has just gone through the pain of labor, how was I supposed to know when was too much pain?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_VS9kBNXUjEl9f_SNHNQTnQ.jpeg\" alt=\"Do I look happy to you? No. Happy is not the word I would use.\"></p>\n<p>I have a picture of myself from this time. In it, my daughter is trying to nurse on my functioning side while I’m using a pump to collect the milk on the injured side. My eyes are hollow, almost empty, my face is pale. I’m exhausted and emotional, trying to keep up with the round-the-clock pumping cycle. I remember feeling like I wasn’t actually getting to know my new daughter, so focused was I on keeping her body alive and healthy. My own body had lost a lot of blood during the birth and was struggling to keep up with the energy requirements of feeding another human while at the same time healing itself. I remember bursting into tears without warning and for reasons I couldn’t explain.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, I realized I wasn’t going to be able to tough it out and got the help of a lactation consultant. She was kind, warm, engaged — and actually had some strategies that I couldn’t find for myself online. We visited a pediatric dentist to see if Nyaanina had a lip or tongue tie restricting her latch (maybe, said the dentist, but if we wanted to pay $500 they could just clip it for us anyway. We declined.) We took her to a chiropractor to try what I remember to be basically a baby massage and a lot of chatter about how she’d probably take a big poop after the session (also not clear what help that was). The lactation consultant got us onto a “block feeding” routine which if memory serves involved exclusive pumping on the injured side while Nina drank from the healthy side. This support eventually sorted us out and after a few more weeks, Nina and I settled into a breastfeeding relationship that lasted for a year.</p>\n<p>When I finally emerged from this fog of new parenthood, I wanted to find out why the experience had been so horrible.

I had an electric breast pump, I had a specialist covered by my insurance, I could afford to take unpaid leave, I had a supportive partner and family, and I had the belief that I was the kind of person who breastfed. Over the past few months, as I’ve been speaking with parents across the country as part of our <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/\">Make the Breast Pump Not Suck project</a>, I have come to see that many, many people don’t have these privileges.</p>\n<p>And an interesting thing has begun to happen.

It sparks when I learn about black and brown parents, after long hours of labor, finding themselves in post-partum conversations with (mostly white) lactation consultants who either assume they aren’t going to breastfeed and don’t ask many questions to find out how it’s going — or micro-aggress to kingdom come with pushy and condescending advice, focusing overly on shoving mom’s nipple into baby’s mouth, instead of building a relationship that allows mom to feel pride in learning how to do this for herself. It sparks when I hear — again, from many, many parents — how breastfeeding stopped when mom returned to work after 6 weeks of leave, none of which was actually paid, but rather taken at 60% of her salary as “short-term disability.” And it sparks when I hear parents wonder, again and again and again, whether there was something more they could have done to coax their bodies into the “breast is best” ideal that is glorified in online forms, in their pediatricians’ offices, and in that uniquely American “have it all” approach to womaning.</p>\n<p>There is a quiet thunder of pain, shame, anger, dismay, and powerlessness that so many new parents feel about their reproductive experiences.

After three hours under the lights, we’d get her for barely 30 minutes, and then we would begrudgingly hand her back to the nurses to return under the lights. During those precious minutes holding this new, warm soul, I would do my best to get her to feed from the breast — a choice I was determined to stick with, over formula. Our doctors had told us that the only way for her to improve was to make her excrete as much as possible. Although many women don’t start using a breast pump until weeks after birth, I was hooked up to one on day two, so that we could ramp up my supply as rapidly as possible (or so I thought). I remember the lactation consultant at the hospital giving me a quick tutorial on the machine and handing me a bunch of syringes to collect the colostrum my breasts would produce.\n\n![We started calling Nina “Lieutenant NiSo” for her ability to soldier on through all of the feedings she underwent in those first few weeks. She moved up to General rank pretty quickly…](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_iIB-fy6Pc5GN4WWdoRGKsw.jpeg)\n\nOur process was this: I would attempt to feed her at the breast, then hand her over to her dad, who would try to keep her awake to drink another serving of pumped milk, while I then attached my body to the uncomfortable and noisy breast pump in order to produce her next dose of boob juice. I didn’t really understand how the machine worked, but I knew I was supposed to ramp up the suction to a certain level and then just let it stay on for a while. When we left the hospital after five days, we had to go through this process every 1.5 hours, around the clock, for a week — and then every 2–3 hours, around the clock, for a few weeks after that.\n\nThankfully, my milk came in pretty quickly, but the crushing pumping routine led to an oversupply that overwhelmed my daughter’s ability to drink all the milk available. Trying to swallow from a veritable fire hose, she compensated with a latch that left my nipple cracked. I would cringe every time she attempted to feed on my injured side. I had heard people tell me “breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt” but that seemed both incorrect and also impractical. Breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt too badly is probably a more accurate statement — but for a first-time parent who has just gone through the pain of labor, how was I supposed to know when was too much pain?\n\n![Do I look happy to you? No. Happy is not the word I would use.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_VS9kBNXUjEl9f_SNHNQTnQ.jpeg)\n\nI have a picture of myself from this time. In it, my daughter is trying to nurse on my functioning side while I’m using a pump to collect the milk on the injured side. My eyes are hollow, almost empty, my face is pale. I’m exhausted and emotional, trying to keep up with the round-the-clock pumping cycle. I remember feeling like I wasn’t actually getting to know my new daughter, so focused was I on keeping her body alive and healthy. My own body had lost a lot of blood during the birth and was struggling to keep up with the energy requirements of feeding another human while at the same time healing itself. I remember bursting into tears without warning and for reasons I couldn’t explain.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I realized I wasn’t going to be able to tough it out and got the help of a lactation consultant. She was kind, warm, engaged — and actually had some strategies that I couldn’t find for myself online. We visited a pediatric dentist to see if Nyaanina had a lip or tongue tie restricting her latch (maybe, said the dentist, but if we wanted to pay $500 they could just clip it for us anyway. We declined.) We took her to a chiropractor to try what I remember to be basically a baby massage and a lot of chatter about how she’d probably take a big poop after the session (also not clear what help that was). The lactation consultant got us onto a “block feeding” routine which if memory serves involved exclusive pumping on the injured side while Nina drank from the healthy side. This support eventually sorted us out and after a few more weeks, Nina and I settled into a breastfeeding relationship that lasted for a year.\n\nWhen I finally emerged from this fog of new parenthood, I wanted to find out why the experience had been so horrible. An ethnographer, my immediate method was to talk to other parents. As I have begun to speak with them, I have learned that not only was my experience common — I actually had it good! I had an electric breast pump, I had a specialist covered by my insurance, I could afford to take unpaid leave, I had a supportive partner and family, and I had the belief that I was the kind of person who breastfed.

The curriculum was developed in partnership with Green Gold Animation, the Indian Red Cross Society, the Mary Anne Charity Trust, and and a Working Group of NGOs and civil society groups dedicated to improving sanitation and hygiene in Tamil Nadu.

Following Bheem’s lead, children work to defeat an evil Germ Wizard that loves to spread germs and filth in the community. Children engage in interactive classroom activities that are based on the stories, and they play a digital mobile game that reinforces learning goals. At the end of each lesson, teachers give children a challenge to complete before the next week to defeat the Germ Wizard, such as making soapy water bottles and teaching friends about what they learned.\n\nFrom January 22nd–26th, **Eric Gordon, Executive Director of the Engagement Lab and Professor at Emerson College,** and **Mary Beth Dawson, Project Manager at the Engagement Lab,** visited Tamil Nadu to train teachers to implement the hygiene and sanitation curriculum.

In an increasingly hostile environment, Twitter users understand that they have no say in the company addressing these issues (although they will @ Jack Dorsey to no end).

What would it take for users to buy Twitter and form a cooperative? Could we create space for media and communications without being constrained by a need to maximize financial profit, but instead liberated to explore ways to maximize social gains?</p>\n<p>These questions come out of the platform cooperativism movement, which seeks to bring greater responsibility and equity to digitally mediated businesses models. Rooted in the principles and models of cooperatives, the platform cooperativism movement**** seeks to reimagine the relationships that define modes of production in “platformized” business, where high profits rely on exploitative labor practices. In the setting of the #Buytwitter movement, one of the more prominent motivations is a need to redefine what governance looks like such that users have a greater say in ensuring the platform is a more inclusive and less hostile environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_2EXHxhvOJQovA0fN.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"platform-cooperativism-and-civic-media\"><em>Platform Cooperativism and Civic Media</em></h3>\n<p>The tactical proposition to buy Twitter mirrors a growing conversation around civic media practice, an approach to media making born out the need to rebuild media infrastructure in the image of productive public engagement.</p>\n<p>In the introduction to the edited collection <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/civic-media\">*Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice</a>,* Gordon and Mihailidis define civic media as “any mediated practice that enables a community to imagine themselves as being connected, not through achieving, but through striving for common good” (2016: 2). Civic Media is therefore a description of media making rather than a genre of media. It is a process inspired by an ethic of care, where caring is a “species of activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our ‘world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible” (Fisher and Tronto, 1990).</p>\n<p>For example, this care ethic in the context of media making can be seen in the work of City Bureau, a newspaper in Chicago’s Southside that brings residents into the core of its operation by not only hosting its Public Newsroom to discuss with residents what issues need the most attention, but also actively trains and supports residents to be their own reporters. At its core, City Bureau’s practice is focused on how it listens to and supports its neighborhood so that issues affecting the community are represented and circulated for public conversation.</p>\n<p>Like City Bureau, the #BuyTwitter activists seeks to redefine the relationship between an infrastructure of media distribution and production and its constituents. The shift in this relationship is one that would allow for the public to take greater care of an infrastructure that has value to democratic processes. Bringing people into the core of governing a media resource is where we see the goals and visions of platform cooperativism and civic media align. We also see a shared problem space, one that is concerned with scale.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_8qZeZNQB2KZSvH8s.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"cooperatives-and-civic-media-at-scale\"><em>Cooperatives and Civic Media at Scale</em></h3>\n<p>For a group like City Bureau, the scale of including and supporting a range of interest will always be bound by the geography of the neighborhood where they work. Similarly, while there are indeed exceptions, many cooperatives operate with a small member base. A space like Twitter however poses an interesting challenge for both civic media and platform cooperatives. Twitter does not have a unified audience or interest group. Users with competing political ideologies and world views are active on the platform and may have different views about the purpose of Twitter as a tool for communication. While the proposition to make Twitter a cooperative does not intend to favor any specific political position, it is likely to create well-defined boundaries around its purpose and function as a communication tool. In other words, as a response to an increasingly hostile and unproductive environment, the outcome of the the #BuyTwitter will likely lead to well defined approaches to governance and moderation and will remain content agnostic to the extent that content does not infringe on Twitter as a tool for a productive public sphere.</p>\n<p>Scholars and practitioners of civic media and platform cooperativism are watching the #BuyTwitter campaign closely. As practitioners and scholars of civic media and platform cooperativism, we are particularly interested in understanding what a media practice rooted in an ethic of care look like at scale, and what the negotiation of shared interests will look like for a large scale media platforms like Twitter?</p>\n<p>The #BuyTwitter campaign offers us a unique case study into what it would take to remake a giant media infrastructure in the image of values that align with interest of the many rather than a few, in the interests of social good rather than profit, and in the interest of robust and diverse and productive public sphere rather than a forum of divisiveness. Because of the overlaps around processes for negotiating shared interests, we encourage scholars and practitioners from the spaces of platform cooperativism and civic media to explore collaboration and knowledge sharing so as to not only benefit the #BuyTwitter movement, but other media based initiatives that seek to regain trust and cooperative governance strategies.</p>\n<pre><code>\nFor further reading on #BuyTwitter, follow [@BuyThisPlatform](https://twitter.com/BuyThisPlatform)\n\n</code></pre>","md":"# **#BuyTwitter and the Intersection of Civic Media and Platform Cooperativism**\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_ndfgAjjn-jc-EyBd.png)\n\n_By [Gabriel Mugar](), [Danny Spitzberg]()_ _, and Eric Gordon_\n\nThere is a growing distrust in the ability of large institutions to represent a diversity of views and needs.

Could we create space for media and communications without being constrained by a need to maximize financial profit, but instead liberated to explore ways to maximize social gains?\n\nThese questions come out of the platform cooperativism movement, which seeks to bring greater responsibility and equity to digitally mediated businesses models. Rooted in the principles and models of cooperatives, the platform cooperativism movement\\*\\*\\*\\* seeks to reimagine the relationships that define modes of production in “platformized” business, where high profits rely on exploitative labor practices. In the setting of the #Buytwitter movement, one of the more prominent motivations is a need to redefine what governance looks like such that users have a greater say in ensuring the platform is a more inclusive and less hostile environment.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_2EXHxhvOJQovA0fN.png)\n\n### _Platform Cooperativism and Civic Media_\n\nThe tactical proposition to buy Twitter mirrors a growing conversation around civic media practice, an approach to media making born out the need to rebuild media infrastructure in the image of productive public engagement.\n\nIn the introduction to the edited collection [\\*Civic Media: Technology, Design, Practice](https://mitpress.mit.edu/civic-media),\\* Gordon and Mihailidis define civic media as “any mediated practice that enables a community to imagine themselves as being connected, not through achieving, but through striving for common good” (2016: 2). Civic Media is therefore a description of media making rather than a genre of media. It is a process inspired by an ethic of care, where caring is a “species of activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our ‘world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible” (Fisher and Tronto, 1990).\n\nFor example, this care ethic in the context of media making can be seen in the work of City Bureau, a newspaper in Chicago’s Southside that brings residents into the core of its operation by not only hosting its Public Newsroom to discuss with residents what issues need the most attention, but also actively trains and supports residents to be their own reporters. At its core, City Bureau’s practice is focused on how it listens to and supports its neighborhood so that issues affecting the community are represented and circulated for public conversation.\n\nLike City Bureau, the #BuyTwitter activists seeks to redefine the relationship between an infrastructure of media distribution and production and its constituents. The shift in this relationship is one that would allow for the public to take greater care of an infrastructure that has value to democratic processes. Bringing people into the core of governing a media resource is where we see the goals and visions of platform cooperativism and civic media align. We also see a shared problem space, one that is concerned with scale.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_8qZeZNQB2KZSvH8s.png)\n\n### _Cooperatives and Civic Media at Scale_\n\nFor a group like City Bureau, the scale of including and supporting a range of interest will always be bound by the geography of the neighborhood where they work. Similarly, while there are indeed exceptions, many cooperatives operate with a small member base. A space like Twitter however poses an interesting challenge for both civic media and platform cooperatives. Twitter does not have a unified audience or interest group. Users with competing political ideologies and world views are active on the platform and may have different views about the purpose of Twitter as a tool for communication. While the proposition to make Twitter a cooperative does not intend to favor any specific political position, it is likely to create well-defined boundaries around its purpose and function as a communication tool. In other words, as a response to an increasingly hostile and unproductive environment, the outcome of the the #BuyTwitter will likely lead to well defined approaches to governance and moderation and will remain content agnostic to the extent that content does not infringe on Twitter as a tool for a productive public sphere.\n\nScholars and practitioners of civic media and platform cooperativism are watching the #BuyTwitter campaign closely. As practitioners and scholars of civic media and platform cooperativism, we are particularly interested in understanding what a media practice rooted in an ethic of care look like at scale, and what the negotiation of shared interests will look like for a large scale media platforms like Twitter?\n\nThe #BuyTwitter campaign offers us a unique case study into what it would take to remake a giant media infrastructure in the image of values that align with interest of the many rather than a few, in the interests of social good rather than profit, and in the interest of robust and diverse and productive public sphere rather than a forum of divisiveness. Because of the overlaps around processes for negotiating shared interests, we encourage scholars and practitioners from the spaces of platform cooperativism and civic media to explore collaboration and knowledge sharing so as to not only benefit the #BuyTwitter movement, but other media based initiatives that seek to regain trust and cooperative governance strategies.\n\n```\n\nFor further reading on #BuyTwitter, follow [@BuyThisPlatform](https://twitter.com/BuyThisPlatform)\n\n\n```\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2018-02-07T05:00:00Z"},"key":"buytwitter-and-the-intersection-of-civic-media-and-platform-cooperativism","__v":0}

Children’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured at baseline, two weeks after the curriculum ended, and 15 weeks after the curriculum ended in several ways:\n\n-   Surveys with children randomly selected from each age group\n\n-   Structured observations of children’s handwashing behavior at Tippy Taps\n\n-   Structured observations of the curriculum being implemented\n\n-   Soap use measurements\n\n-   Video observations of Tippy Taps\n\n-   Focus groups in schools that participated in _Handwashing with Ananse_\n\n![Children participate in Handwashing with Ananse games during a training with facilitators in March 2016.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_GjwPyOp8x5mHkW0u.jpeg)\n\n&gt; &gt; The study showed a significantly higher increase in knowledge of how to wash hands with soap among children who participated in _Handwashing with Ananse_.\n\nThe study showed a significantly higher increase in knowledge of how to wash hands with soap among children who participated in _Handwashing with Ananse_. Knowledge of why and when to wash hands with soap was very high at baseline and did not increase significantly. _Handwashing with Ananse_ also motivated children to talk about handwashing with their friends and family significantly more than children in the control group. Surveys, Tippy Tap observations, soap measurements, and video observations all showed a significantly higher increase in handwashing behavior for children who participated in _Handwashing with Ananse_ than in the control group that received only handwashing infrastructure. Self-reported illness dropped in both the intervention and control groups, but it significantly dropped by 8.2% more in the intervention group that received _Handwashing with Ananse_ 15 weeks after the curriculum ended.\n\nThe evaluation provides evidence that _Handwashing with Ananse_ is effective in shifting handwashing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among primary school age children. _Handwashing with Ananse_ is being considered by the Ghana Educational Service for wider implementation and integration into the primary school curriculum in Ghana.\n\nTo learn more about _Handwashing with Ananse,_ download the curriculum materials, and read a full report on its evaluation [here](https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/handwashing-with-ananse).\n\n¹ World Health Organization.

Topics that he has worked on range from substance abuse, violence prevention, trauma response, HIV education, public safety, and youth development. He has joined CMAP to further explore the role of art and media technology and how it can be used as a tool to empower and engage communities.

I often created workshops for families, young people, and those looking to become engaged in their community though civics. I soon felt like I needed a new environment to step into. I wanted to learn about new media tools and technology that were being used to address community related issues. I had studied Graphic Design during my undergrad, and often incorporated much of what I learned of visual communication into my work in the non-profit sector. I wanted to go back to grad school and continue to explore other people based designs and its impact on our civic culture.</p>\n<p>*<em>What does civic media mean to you?\n*</em>Civic media is a very layered and complicated term. It is still such a young field to have such a singular definition. For me, civic media has been about the analysis of the societal culture and norms to help identify an issue, topic, or problem that may need assistance, disruption, or to be highlighted. Through the lens of media, technology, and design, civic media can provide the community a level of accessibility that creates engagement. It helps to tackle an issue through tangible tools and actions that the community can then utilize for self-determination.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_SdqKbvqoiPg98-DeZpsj5w.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; Civic media has been about the analysis of the societal culture and norms to help identify an issue, topic, or problem that may need assistance, disruption, or to be highlighted.</p>\n<p>*<em>What is one change you would like to see in the world?\n*</em>There are too many issues that I would love to see change in this world to just limit myself to one. However I think the one thing that I would love to see more of is the acknowledgment of the contributions that people of color have made to the design and science community. Representation is very important to me and often times our stories are regulated to a supporting role when we were often a significant factor in a discovery or tech development.

Each uses play to immerse children in a storyworld to learn about important public health messages, in ways that are relevant to them.”\n\n&gt; **\\*— Mary Beth Dawson**, **Project Manager at the Engagement Lab.\\***\n\n![Image from Handwashing With Ananse storybook.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_8KOSNzxXY8b05a38BiT7ig.png)\n\nThrough interactive stories of _Ananse the Spider_, a traditional character from Ghanaian folklore, **Handwashing with Ananse** teaches primary school children in Ghana the importance of handwashing. **Hygiene with Chhota Bheem** is centered around the popular Indian cartoon character _Bheem_, who teaches children to defeat an evil Germ Wizard by washing their hands and using the toilet. In both projects, children are encouraged to play games based on the stories, practice handwashing with soap and soapy water as well as teach their peers what they have learned.\n\n![Download the Hygiene with Chhota Bheem Android mobile game in the Google Play Store here.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_czfXtvP36lnO5vLLtm8U_w.png)\n\n&gt; “The Engagement Lab’s expertise is in designing media experiences that motivate public mindedness and action taking. These projects are exciting demonstrations of the power of play in encouraging individuals to take care of the public’s health.”\n\n&gt; **\\*— Eric Gordon**,** Executive Director of the Engagement Lab and Professor at Emerson College**.\\*\n\n**Handwashing with Ananse** was designed in partnership with [UNICEF Ghana](http://www.unicef.org/ghana/) and the [Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre](http://www.climatecentre.org/).** Hygiene with Chhota Bheem** was developed in partnership with [Green Gold Animation](http://www.greengold.tv/), the [Indian Red Cross Society](http://www.indianredcross.org/), the [Mary Anne Charity Trust](http://www.mactindia.org/), and a Working Group of NGOs and civil society groups dedicated to improving sanitation and hygiene in Tamil Nadu. Both were designed and playtested with children in Ghana and India over several months through partnerships with the Red Cross. The design and evaluation of **Handwashing with Ananse** and **Hygiene with Chhota Bheem** were made possible by funding from [UNICEF Ghana](http://www.unicef.org/ghana/) and the [UBS Optimus Foundation](https://www.ubs.com/microsites/optimus-foundation/en/home.html).\n\nLearn more about **Handwashing with Ananse** [here](https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/game-based-curriculum-improves-handwashing-practice-among-primary-school-children-in-ghana-de09af62f5de)\\***\\* and\\*\\*** about **Hygiene with Chhota Bheem** [here](https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/engagement-lab-creates-game-based-curriculum-for-sanitation-project-in-india-fb3d33a068aa)**.**\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2018-04-04T04:00:00Z"},"key":"engagement-labs-handwashing-games-win-international-award","__v":0}

As a result of that process, she developed a technical aptitude for digital recording. Expanding those skills to podcasting turned out to be a new challenge for Ladd.</p>\n<p>“Learning how to make [a podcast] episode and make it interesting has been a very public learning process,” says Ladd. “The difference from the initial [podcast] episode I put out to the most recent one is kind of hilarious, but I like being able to see that progression. Learning how to talk, learning how to write, learning how to integrate an interview with your own voice; I learned how to do all of that as I went through.”</p>\n<p>Wanting to release a full series at once rather than just one episode at a time, Ladd didn’t release her first season of “Ok But Who Cares” until the summer of 2017. “I was really nervous to do it,” says Ladd. “I’m learning how to talk about failure more now. Everyone on the Internet wants to be like ‘I am doing so well!’ and when I graduated [from undergrad] and I didn’t think I was really doing well, I didn’t want to post about it, but as I got back into doing stuff again I wanted to feel comfortable talking about that…I think so many creative people get stuck on feeling like they need to know everything before they start.

She knew how to introduce things, when to put music in.

She immediately knew that she wanted to submit her idea, but other responsibilities kept her from preparing her application, and combined with a lack of confidence about her idea, she nearly didn’t apply.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until a few days before the deadline that she had an unexpected cache of time, and she decided to seize the moment to create the trailer that won her a spot as a finalist in the competition. “I was shocked,” says Ladd. “At that point I was like ‘why are you people talking to me?’…but [the Casting Call crew] was just really excited about [the idea] from the start.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Ladd won the “Casting Call” competition with her podcast An Exciting Business Opportunity. “I really just wanted to make something that I would want to listen to, which is often my goal, and I think we did that. I’m really really proud of it, and I’m excited for the next three [podcast episodes] that we get to make now.”</p>\n<p>Lindsay Goldberg, fellow member of the 2018 CMAP cohort, had been following Ladd’s creations since even before the two discovered they would be attending graduate school together at Emerson.

This year, Emerson College will recognize Civic Media: Art &amp; Practice graduate Melissa Teng for her thesis project “Back To Reality: Participatory Design of a Virtual Reality Training Program for Reentry with Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women.” We sat down with Melissa to talk with her about her project, and how it feels to be recognized for this achievement.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_NLE9e1W8hSUQ-fJwzQm3SA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Melissa Teng’s award-winning thesis work, which has since been renamed <em>Covr</em>, began as a participatory design project, but over time has transitioned into what Melissa now embraces as a social justice initiative. The initiative began in 2018 as Melissa’s research design thesis, in partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Correction (DOC) for the minimum-security/pre-release women’s prison South Middlesex Correctional Center (SMCC).</p>\n<p>“The original project basically covered the production of a series of virtual reality videos that were created using participatory methods,” Melissa told us. “The videos were designed to be part of a reentry program for help women transitioning out of prison to better deal with some of the emotional and psychological challenges of re-entering the community.”</p>\n<p>Since then, the project has grown to encompass much more. “Now the VR content is just a beginning to a conversation about the larger project.”</p>\n<p>This project was uncharted territory for Melissa when she began. “I didn’t know much about criminal justice or VR beyond surface level,” she recalls. Managing expectations, becoming educated about mass incarceration, and learning about VR at the same time proved a challenging collection of tasks.</p>\n<p>“We [Melissa and her advisor, Eric Gordon] got a tour of South Middlesex Correctional Center, and then I just started working and learning as I went. [At that time,] I was just trying to get my bearings and make sure that I was doing something that would be helpful to the women inside South Middlesex.”</p>\n<p>Melissa recognizes the moment when she was able to share the 360-video prototype in the actual VR headset as a turning point for the project. “After our editor [alumnus and VR filmographer Barry Pousman] layered the voice overs into the 360 videos and exported the first drafts, that’s when things really started to change, because that’s when people who actually work with formerly incarcerated folks saw the project’s potential and we started to get their buy-in and feedback.”</p>\n<p>Before then, it had been challenging to express the value that VR was capable of creating as a new technology, but “as soon as we had a demo in hand,” Melissa recalled, “I could give a brief introduction, and then let the prototype speak for itself. People would be like, ‘OK, I see the value of this, and not only that, but I see and hear how this includes the actual voices of people who have lived this experience, and I want to connect you to X and Y.’”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_3_WYbP2HzcOEvgIhxidYPg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Initially, Melissa did not see Covr as a social justice-oriented project. “Now I feel like we have a pretty dedicated and wide-ranging community of people around the project, including individual returning citizens as well as reentry and recovery organizations,” she says.</p>\n<p>“These days, it’s these people who push me to continue this work, because they see the social impact we can make. It’s mostly because of this community that now I feel like I’m much more comfortable positioning this as a social justice project.”</p>\n<p>Melissa understands that, as a designer, she must at some point move away from any project so that it can be turned over to the people for whom it was made. “We created these immersive short stories about these emotional challenges.

This year, Emerson College will recognize Civic Media: Art &amp; Practice graduate Melissa Teng for her thesis project “Back To Reality: Participatory Design of a Virtual Reality Training Program for Reentry with Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women.” We sat down with Melissa to talk with her about her project, and how it feels to be recognized for this achievement._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_NLE9e1W8hSUQ-fJwzQm3SA.jpeg)\n\nMelissa Teng’s award-winning thesis work, which has since been renamed _Covr_, began as a participatory design project, but over time has transitioned into what Melissa now embraces as a social justice initiative. The initiative began in 2018 as Melissa’s research design thesis, in partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Correction (DOC) for the minimum-security/pre-release women’s prison South Middlesex Correctional Center (SMCC).\n\n“The original project basically covered the production of a series of virtual reality videos that were created using participatory methods,” Melissa told us. “The videos were designed to be part of a reentry program for help women transitioning out of prison to better deal with some of the emotional and psychological challenges of re-entering the community.”\n\nSince then, the project has grown to encompass much more. “Now the VR content is just a beginning to a conversation about the larger project.”\n\nThis project was uncharted territory for Melissa when she began. “I didn’t know much about criminal justice or VR beyond surface level,” she recalls. Managing expectations, becoming educated about mass incarceration, and learning about VR at the same time proved a challenging collection of tasks.\n\n“We [Melissa and her advisor, Eric Gordon] got a tour of South Middlesex Correctional Center, and then I just started working and learning as I went. [At that time,] I was just trying to get my bearings and make sure that I was doing something that would be helpful to the women inside South Middlesex.”\n\nMelissa recognizes the moment when she was able to share the 360-video prototype in the actual VR headset as a turning point for the project. “After our editor [alumnus and VR filmographer Barry Pousman] layered the voice overs into the 360 videos and exported the first drafts, that’s when things really started to change, because that’s when people who actually work with formerly incarcerated folks saw the project’s potential and we started to get their buy-in and feedback.”\n\nBefore then, it had been challenging to express the value that VR was capable of creating as a new technology, but “as soon as we had a demo in hand,” Melissa recalled, “I could give a brief introduction, and then let the prototype speak for itself. People would be like, ‘OK, I see the value of this, and not only that, but I see and hear how this includes the actual voices of people who have lived this experience, and I want to connect you to X and Y.’”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_3_WYbP2HzcOEvgIhxidYPg.jpeg)\n\nInitially, Melissa did not see Covr as a social justice-oriented project. “Now I feel like we have a pretty dedicated and wide-ranging community of people around the project, including individual returning citizens as well as reentry and recovery organizations,” she says.\n\n“These days, it’s these people who push me to continue this work, because they see the social impact we can make. It’s mostly because of this community that now I feel like I’m much more comfortable positioning this as a social justice project.”\n\nMelissa understands that, as a designer, she must at some point move away from any project so that it can be turned over to the people for whom it was made. “We created these immersive short stories about these emotional challenges. Is there a way we can replicate this: improve our process of creating that media and teach that to others, specifically returning citizens, so that they can own the production of this VR media?” Melissa says.\n\n“I’ve also been talking with people who specialize in peer-supported mental health recovery about the actual facilitation aspect, or what happens before you put the headset on and what happens after you take it off. Once we figure out a good model of facilitating these VR recovery groups, can we share those skills with returning citizens so that they can also lead the facilitation aspect of this process?\n\n![Incarcerated women worked closely with Melissa to develop and refine the narratives that would eventually be presented as short films in VR.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_9G0QCCjYNfAJy09IFK5-iw.png)\n\n“Where we’re at currently with this project is thinking about it in two parts: first, it’s a peer-supported VR-aided recovery experience drawing on restorative justice and behavioral science practices, and second, it’s a way for returning citizens to build hopefully marketable skills in media production and facilitation and serve as mentors for their peers, with the goal of helping with their future employment.”\n\n_Covr_ is currently being piloted at South Middlesex Correctional Center with the MA DOC, and there’s interest in scaling the program statewide if the pilot proves effective.

We sat down with Lauren to talk about her experience in the program, how it’s shaped her path, and what she’s up to now.</em></p>\n<p>What makes a city whole? How can a city be a place where every community member can get the things that they want and need? Coming from a background in government, Lauren Stott found that efficiency was a common measuring tool. “I kind of came from that background of ‘efficiency is critical.’ You hear that in government all the time: ‘how can we be more efficient?’”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_O8y77F-o5Dou_xNORXkO1Q.jpeg\" alt=\"Stott presents her final Thesis project to the CMAP Leadership Team.\"></p>\n<p>But what Stott discovered through the CMAP program is that to create a truly whole city, you need more than just efficiency — you need the people in your city to feel connected and valued.</p>\n<p>Stott’s career began in journalism. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from Northern Illinois University in 2011, and went on to pursue her Masters in Public Administration at the same institution. “I started as a journalist, and then I moved into working in the public sector in local governments in Illinois, and I was starting to feel frustrated at the lack of community engagement as a priority in public projects.” Stott wanted to activate positive change in this area, but she felt that she did not have the skills that would allow her to do this. She went searching for a program that could support her in acquiring the knowledge to be able to activate meaningful change in this realm. “I found CMAP, and I thought, ‘this seems like a great way to learn about engagement,’” says Stott, “but what I learned [from the program] is not how to add community engagement to public projects, but how to develop public projects with public input, co-designing public initiatives that better serve community members.”</p>\n<p>Through her work on the Smart Cities initiative, a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/new-urban-mechanics\">The City of Boston’s Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics (MONUM)</a>, Stott has learned a great deal about how to make community members feel more connected and supported. “What [MONUM] initially wanted was a resource matching platform for Smart City Projects…but what I found through interviews [with community stakeholders] is that technology wasn’t their main concern, it was more about making community connections, seeing locations where projects are happening, and just having a forum to say ‘this is my issue, maybe community members can help me solve it…[The CMAP program] has really transformed my thinking around what is the best way to serve stakeholders.”</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “…what I learned [from the project] is not how to add community engagement to public projects, but how to develop public projects with public input, co-designing public initiatives that better serve community members.”</p>\n<p>Stott cites the CMAP program’s emphasis on community partnerships and working directly with community organizations as unique part of the program. “I’ve gone through other school programs which have been great, but they’re really theory-based, and CMAP does have that theory component, but it really focuses on how can we get out into the community and what the needs are instead of just sitting in a classroom talking about them.”</p>\n<p>Through her experiences in CMAP, Stott gained a greater understanding of community needs. “Learning about the idea of ‘meaningful inefficiencies’ and why play is important, and why maybe an interaction you have with a customer service person might take longer, but if it’s more joyful then it’s probably going to be a better engagement than it would be if it was ‘here’s your money, now you can go.’” Those concepts transformed Stott’s thinking around serving communities. “Civic media is important because it gives people that outlet to say ‘I can influence my community,” says Stott. In her view, a whole city is about everyone getting what they want and need from their community, whether that’s an efficient transaction, or a more joyful experience; cities need to be able to offer the right balance to suit everyone’s needs. “I know that’s hard, resources are limited, but in order for a city to be robust and for people to feel like they’re a part of it, they have to be able to shape it in some way. If you live in a city but you don’t feel like it’s yours, then you’re not going feel invested in it, or you’re not going to feel like ‘I care what happens in my neighborhood.’”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_DDppwyFTCJp2huLciYRxvA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Another project that Stott worked on while in CMAP was the <a href=\"https://www.journalofcivicmedia.org/\">Journal of Civic Media</a>, where she served as the editor. In considering what shape the Journal might take, the team looked to the styles of other journals, and decided what would best fit topics of civic media. “There’s super academic journal format that’s really rigid, and then on the other end there’s the journal with more broad, more frequent posts, with less of an academic focus. We kind of landed right in the middle,” says Stott. “It’s an academic journal, it’s peer reviewed, but because civic media has that spirit of more creativity and flexibility, we wanted it to be a little more relaxed, and with content that was accessible to right now; things that people are working on immediately.” The Journal just launched its first issue this month and is available for free at <a href=\"http://www.journalofcivicmedia.org\">journalofcivicmedia.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Stott is now back in local government as a Management Fellow with the Manager’s Office of the City of Raleigh, NC. Her fellowship began in August 2018, and lasts a little over a year. As part of her thesis, Lauren talked with many stakeholders in the development of her project; now, Stott is forming connections within her new community of Raleigh. “I work in the City Manager’s Office for another couple of months, and then I’ll actually work in a department. I’m talking with some of the [city] departments to see if they have projects where I could do human-centered design and co-design with community members.” Building out from the foundation of authentic community relationships allows Stott to feel confident as a design professional who is trying to make things better for people. “I’m excited to hopefully put [CMAP] into practice.” says Stott.</p>\n<p><em>Our Civic Media: Art and Practice MA program has a brand new name: Media Design! <a href=\"https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/program-director-paul-mihailidis-on-our-ma-in-media-design-same-mission-clearer-approach-ca673cdd96b4\">Learn more about the future of the program</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.emerson.edu/academics/media-design-ma\">apply today</a> (priority application deadline is March 1).</em></p>\n","md":"\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_SuX6M6DnwApFQ9if3UGV8A.png)\n\n_Lauren Stott is a member of the 2017 cohort of the [Civic Media, Art and Practice (CMAP) Program at Emerson College](https://www.emerson.edu/academics/media-design-ma).

He has been making movies ever since he was a kid</em>,_ but it’s just recently that he’s begun to officially embrace “filmmaker” as part of his identity. We talked with Herman about what attracted him to movie-making, and what makes film such a rich medium for igniting change._</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_zkQADk8t0JjrIwKrJCuMLw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>“I’ve always seen myself as the kind of person who’s never been able to say I’m anything specific,” Servatius says, “but recently, ever since coming to Emerson, I have been telling people that I’m a filmmaker.” Servatius admits that his professional identity is still evolving, but when he describes his vision of activating positive change in our communities, it is through the lens of film: “film can tell stories that other people might not see, and also show people viewpoints or angles on life or story that they may have never considered before; [film is] a very powerful tool for that.”</p>\n<p>Servatius grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts and graduated from Worcester State University with his BS in Communication and Environmental Studies in the spring of 2018. Many of his movies come from inspiration in the moment, as well as a personal guiding principle to free himself of perfection and move directly from the kernel of the idea into the act of creation.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned that the sooner you can make something happen, the better,” says Servatius. “When you don’t think something’s going to come out the way you want it to, it can sometimes turn out even better than you wanted it to, just by jumping into it, because you see stuff while you’re doing it that you didn’t realize you wanted in the first place.”</p>\n<p>He credits one of his great-aunts for his seize-the-moment mentality: “she would say stuff like ‘when you have an idea, just do it right away — just do it, and then it will be done and you can move on to the next idea.’” “She passed away when I was really young,” Servatius recollects, “but I still remember those words…that’s where the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCANO9M_926sP04ler4P4XBw\">videos on my YouTube channel</a> come from.They’re not great from a technical perspective, but the motivation is that mindset, that if you have an idea, you should just do it.”</p>\n<p>Servatius’s “just do it” philosophy applies not only to creation, but also community action. “In the future,” he says, “I envision making videos or films that show people different viewpoints, and that show people that they can get involved in whatever they want to get involved with, at whatever level they can…I think that the more people that are involved in government and democracy, the better it will be, and the more diverse and fair it will be.”</p>\n<p>Servatius wants to use film to empower community members to contribute to their communities in whatever way they can, even at the smallest level. “Everyone has different lives — everyone has families, some people have multiple jobs, or many different commitments that they have to attend to,” but for that reason, “I want to be able to make films that show people that any level of being active in our government, in any way, will promote the idea of democracy.”</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; “Film can tell stories that other people might not see, and also show people viewpoints or angles on life or story that they may have never considered before; [film is] a very powerful tool for that.”</p>\n<p>Servatius is focusing on documentary film here at Emerson, but almost all of the films on his YouTube channel are humorous, as well as narrative. “[Humor] probably describes me in a big way,” he says. Servatius uses humor as a vehicle to lighten challenging social issues, and to create entry points for dialogue. “That’s something I want to bring to a lot of the stuff that I produce here,” he says, “I want to be able to add some humor, make it more lighthearted”</p>\n<p>When Servatius was 12 or 13, he and his sister Mary made their first film together using an old JVC home video camera. The movie was called <em>Peter the Giant</em> and featured their youngest sibling, Peter; Mary directed and produced. “Mary’s not a filmmaker at all,” remarks Servatius, “I think that was the only video she’s ever made. She shot this video where Peter — who was the shortest in the family — was the tallest person in the family just by using camera angles, and building little props, and making them look smaller, and this really cool manipulation of visuals, and I vividly remember that. That pushed me onto the idea of making films.”</p>\n<p>What ultimately propelled Servatius into movie-making as a medium was a film by Giuseppe Tornatore, <em>The Legend of 1900</em>. “It’s a really beautiful movie that sort of transitioned my focus into filmmaking that tells stories that you wouldn’t normally see,” says Servatius. “The whole concept of the movie is this guy who’s always lived his entire life on a ship and he’s never set foot on land…he’s never seen the outside world, and he likes it that way.</p>\n<p>“What I loved about the movie is that in a very confined space, they tell so much. It’s an ocean liner that goes between New York City and London, and so over the course of this guy’s life you see different eras, different classes, how people are treated, you see the world wars — so in a very confined space, the filmmakers were able to show many many different stories.”</p>\n<p>The nature of those stories, not just their multiplicity, resonated with him: “and a lot of them are untold stories, like immigrant stories on that ship.” Servatius believes that showing people different and unexpected viewpoints through film has the capacity shift perspectives for the better. “Just the act of telling a story from an alternate angle, if the viewer is willing to watch it, can open up their eyes.”</p>\n<p>Servatius believes deeply in the power of democracy. Moreover, Servatius believes firmly that film and video can support democratic ideals, by giving people access to information in a concise, accessible way. “In video, you can condense a lot of information into a small amount of time, and you can also tell people what they need to know without them having to read a 20-page research paper,” he says.

He has been making movies ever since he was a kid_,_ but it’s just recently that he’s begun to officially embrace “filmmaker” as part of his identity. We talked with Herman about what attracted him to movie-making, and what makes film such a rich medium for igniting change._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_zkQADk8t0JjrIwKrJCuMLw.jpeg)\n\n“I’ve always seen myself as the kind of person who’s never been able to say I’m anything specific,” Servatius says, “but recently, ever since coming to Emerson, I have been telling people that I’m a filmmaker.” Servatius admits that his professional identity is still evolving, but when he describes his vision of activating positive change in our communities, it is through the lens of film: “film can tell stories that other people might not see, and also show people viewpoints or angles on life or story that they may have never considered before; [film is] a very powerful tool for that.”\n\nServatius grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts and graduated from Worcester State University with his BS in Communication and Environmental Studies in the spring of 2018. Many of his movies come from inspiration in the moment, as well as a personal guiding principle to free himself of perfection and move directly from the kernel of the idea into the act of creation.\n\n“I’ve learned that the sooner you can make something happen, the better,” says Servatius. “When you don’t think something’s going to come out the way you want it to, it can sometimes turn out even better than you wanted it to, just by jumping into it, because you see stuff while you’re doing it that you didn’t realize you wanted in the first place.”\n\nHe credits one of his great-aunts for his seize-the-moment mentality: “she would say stuff like ‘when you have an idea, just do it right away — just do it, and then it will be done and you can move on to the next idea.’” “She passed away when I was really young,” Servatius recollects, “but I still remember those words…that’s where the [videos on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCANO9M_926sP04ler4P4XBw) come from.They’re not great from a technical perspective, but the motivation is that mindset, that if you have an idea, you should just do it.”\n\nServatius’s “just do it” philosophy applies not only to creation, but also community action. “In the future,” he says, “I envision making videos or films that show people different viewpoints, and that show people that they can get involved in whatever they want to get involved with, at whatever level they can…I think that the more people that are involved in government and democracy, the better it will be, and the more diverse and fair it will be.”\n\nServatius wants to use film to empower community members to contribute to their communities in whatever way they can, even at the smallest level. “Everyone has different lives — everyone has families, some people have multiple jobs, or many different commitments that they have to attend to,” but for that reason, “I want to be able to make films that show people that any level of being active in our government, in any way, will promote the idea of democracy.”\n\n&gt; &gt; “Film can tell stories that other people might not see, and also show people viewpoints or angles on life or story that they may have never considered before; [film is] a very powerful tool for that.”\n\nServatius is focusing on documentary film here at Emerson, but almost all of the films on his YouTube channel are humorous, as well as narrative. “[Humor] probably describes me in a big way,” he says. Servatius uses humor as a vehicle to lighten challenging social issues, and to create entry points for dialogue. “That’s something I want to bring to a lot of the stuff that I produce here,” he says, “I want to be able to add some humor, make it more lighthearted”\n\nWhen Servatius was 12 or 13, he and his sister Mary made their first film together using an old JVC home video camera. The movie was called _Peter the Giant_ and featured their youngest sibling, Peter; Mary directed and produced. “Mary’s not a filmmaker at all,” remarks Servatius, “I think that was the only video she’s ever made. She shot this video where Peter — who was the shortest in the family — was the tallest person in the family just by using camera angles, and building little props, and making them look smaller, and this really cool manipulation of visuals, and I vividly remember that. That pushed me onto the idea of making films.”\n\nWhat ultimately propelled Servatius into movie-making as a medium was a film by Giuseppe Tornatore, _The Legend of 1900_. “It’s a really beautiful movie that sort of transitioned my focus into filmmaking that tells stories that you wouldn’t normally see,” says Servatius. “The whole concept of the movie is this guy who’s always lived his entire life on a ship and he’s never set foot on land…he’s never seen the outside world, and he likes it that way.\n\n“What I loved about the movie is that in a very confined space, they tell so much. It’s an ocean liner that goes between New York City and London, and so over the course of this guy’s life you see different eras, different classes, how people are treated, you see the world wars — so in a very confined space, the filmmakers were able to show many many different stories.”\n\nThe nature of those stories, not just their multiplicity, resonated with him: “and a lot of them are untold stories, like immigrant stories on that ship.” Servatius believes that showing people different and unexpected viewpoints through film has the capacity shift perspectives for the better. “Just the act of telling a story from an alternate angle, if the viewer is willing to watch it, can open up their eyes.”\n\nServatius believes deeply in the power of democracy. Moreover, Servatius believes firmly that film and video can support democratic ideals, by giving people access to information in a concise, accessible way. “In video, you can condense a lot of information into a small amount of time, and you can also tell people what they need to know without them having to read a 20-page research paper,” he says. Servatius uses the example of ballot questions in the voting booth to make this point; he contends that an unbiased video with facts from a trusted source can give people the information that they need to make an informed decision about an issue, even if they may not have the time to devote to extensive research.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_EdeV3VmOcN-0FLV4-aqStg.jpeg)\n\nServatius is excited to put his skills and aspirations to work as he embarks on his thesis project in partnership with [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/), an online educational platform that aims to engage young people in meaningful civic learning. “I chose [iCivics] because I really like their mission statement.

Servatius and Giles Bullen —\n\nPartnering with iCivics, a non-profit organization that provides educational online games and lesson plans to promote civics education, Herman and Giles collaborated to create iCivics Explorer, an app designed to assist students and their teachers in conducting interviews as well as collecting, documenting, and sharing local stories.\n\nThe core principles guiding the design of this app are: learning foundational media creation skills as part of a media literacy education, and creating expressive content around topics of personal interest. By guiding students through the interview process from the planning stages through to writing, iCivics Explorer embodies the process and effects that small civic actions can have.\n\n**Project Title:** A Collective Win-State for the Community and the Players: Facilitating a Co-Creative Design Process with The Boston Ujima Project\n\n**Partner:** The Boston Ujima Project\n\n**Designers:** Emily Baeza &amp; Lea Neilsen\n\nEmily and Lea created _Ujima: A Community Solidarity Game_, a collaborative role playing card game designed in partnership with The Boston Ujima Project. Set in an imaginative neighborhood, players face real-world challenges to pool their resources and collectively decide on which businesses will, or won’t, thrive.\n\nThis game is intended to be played during Ujima’s City-Wide Assemblies in order to empower members to have deliberative and collaborative conversations about the businesses in their communities.\n\n![Guests discuss Elisa’s Media Design project, outlined on the wall behind them.](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_ZPhRGaUBzMmBJnooPL1jnw.jpeg)\n\n**Project Title:** Illuminating Mental Health\n\n**Partner:** Clay Center\n\n**Designer:** Elisa Hamilton\n\nFor her project, Elisa collaborated with The Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Mass General Hospital to create a participatory art model that aims to combat the stigma surrounding mental health issues through a participatory art method called the “illuminated collage.”\n\nThe _Illuminating Mental Health_ workshop model uses collaborative art making in an effort to increase awareness, and to provide an entrypoint for having conversations about mental health. By bringing dialogue about mental health out of the shadows and into the light, Elisa seeks to use this project to normalize conversations about mental health and to provide a collaborative, creative vehicle for identifying, expressing, and sharing feelings.\n\n**Project Title:** Citizen TALES\\* Commons: The Transformative Power of Collective Voice in Academia\n\n**Partner:** Citizen TALES\\* Chorus\n\n**Designer:** Vassiliki Rapti, Ph.D.\n\nVassiliki collaborated with Citizen TALES\\* Chorus, the Engagement Lab, and Missing Link studios to create an immersive project that explores how the adjunct underclass can be empowered today.Seriously asking the question, “what should I/we do against the walls of exclusion?”, Vassiliki shows how she innovated the Greek chorus through collaboration in order to practice direct democracy, “full citizenship” and inclusion, for the sake of the common good.\n\nCitizen TALES\\* Commons is a transformative, holistic, multimodal platform of open communication, both spatial and virtual, facilitated by a website and disseminated through podcasting.

When she was six, her family moved back to Indonesia to start a business in hopes of providing a better life for her and her brother. After facing some difficulties during a financial crisis that hit the country in the mid-90s, Chitra’s family moved back to America and relocated to a suburb in Los Angeles. “And that’s primarily where I’ve been. That’s where I did a chunk of my growing up.”</p>\n<p>After graduating from San Diego State in 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology, Chitra’s pursuit for creativity led her back across the Pacific to Jakarta, Indonesia, where she took on a job as a lifestyle journalist for <em>Prestige</em>, a high society lifestyle magazine. When asked about what motivated her move, Chitra described a sentiment that many post-graduates can probably relate to. “It was literally a classic, young person, ‘I’m just gonna make a move and go bold’ move.”</p>\n<p>“But the main inspiration for my move was to reconnect with my family, since everyone lives in Indonesia, I just wanted to get to know them and get to know my culture a little more because I grew up in a neighborhood that was predominantly white,” explains Chitra. “I felt like I was not in touch with my roots at all.”</p>\n<p>During her initial move to Indonesia as a child, Chitra didn’t have many opportunities to build her relationship with her extended family. “I did not know them at all,” she told us. Spending time with her family as an adult allowed Chitra to discover the similarities they all carry and how it connects them. “With every single person in my family, there’s some part of them that I could see in me.

A defining moment for her was when she had the opportunity to interview American fashion designer Michael Kors a year into the position. “I really, really liked what I did. But after a year and a half of working there, even something that I really enjoyed started to feel kind of routine,” says Chitra. “That’s when I knew that I wanted to pursue something with a little bit more meaning.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_SWPr5LlL--h1U0jD.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This led Chitra back to California to work in nonprofit administration at the <a href=\"https://www.ccala.net/\">Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles</a>, where she helped manage the operations of LA county’s quality rating improvement system for early care and education programs. While she carried out daily operational tasks, Chitra also helped to form different programs, resources, and social media messaging for the agency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_Ir2tp3881sTjDVHO.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>“I had a really great manager who encouraged us to explore different, creative things so long as it was related to the general area of early education,” she told us. One of her most notable projects focused on early brain development. “I had the opportunity to do research on a topic that I’m really interested in, given my background in psychology. And then I created flyers and messaging that could be displayed at various preschool or daycare centers, as well as handouts that parents could take home.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_wRSYS6yh_-1h_90V.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Chitra recognized that the non-profit space doesn’t always have the flexibility to encourage more innovative, community-driven work. “It can be difficult to work with limited funding and resources. Top-down decisions don’t always translate the way that you’d like them to, which is a reason why I was attracted to the Media Design program. It incorporates a community-focused way of designing solutions.”</p>\n<p>For Chitra, coming into the Media Design program after working as a professional came with a few transitions. “I’ve been out of school for a while now, so I had to get back into the rhythm of being a student again and having to get homework done instead of operating on a 9 to 5 schedule.” Despite some initial adjustments, Chitra began to feel at home in her new program and city. “It’s a very personal program with a lot of compassion built into it.” She appreciates the intimacy of having a small cohort, the ability to work so closely with professors and faculty members, and the amount of support and resources that are provided by the Lab and Emerson as a whole. “There are so many resources and so many support systems.” Chitra took on several leadership roles since entering the program, namely as the President of the Media Design Graduate Student Association and a co-organizer for the <a href=\"http://www.sjmsymposium.com/\">Social Media &amp; Justice Symposium</a>, held earlier this year.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic demanded more adjustments from Chitra and the Media Design cohort when in-person classes at Emerson College were suspended and moved online to abide by national social distancing guidelines. Before the pandemic, Chitra and three other cohort members were embarking on a group thesis project in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/recovery-services\">City of Boston’s Mayor’s Office of Recovery Services</a> to address the fundamental concern of low-income youth of color lacking access to substance misuse prevention and prosocial spaces for support, expression and dialog.

Working on group assignments is a lot harder because we are separate and can’t physically be together to just doodle out an idea or glance at each other’s screens. But on the flip side, I feel like it’s nice because it also gives you a bit more free time and does save you the time that you’d spend traveling to meet each other.”</p>\n<p>Creating a participatory prototype hasn’t come without its difficulties, however. “Before COVID, we held one workshop with our stakeholders. This pandemic surged when the majority of our prototype design had to be done, and so we weren’t able to get the same engagement and opportunities for co-creation that we would have been able to in-person.” To Chitra and her thesis group, the design process has felt “kind of backwards, where [they] created a prototype based more on research than user input,” and are now looking to incorporate youth voice and feedback through virtual interviews and focus groups.</p>\n<p>As of right now, the group has designed a virtual platform that connects youth to resources in their community through a series of goal-setting prompts. “Our design is driven by insight from our literature review, which showed that having positive expectations for the future is a protective factor in itself. As of now, there are two components to our prototype: a digital version housing the main prompts, along with a physical journal for youth to elaborate on the prompts and their ideas about their futures. We’re still very much in the iteration process, and we’re planning on holding focus groups with youth to figure out how to fine-tune our prototype so that it’s useful and meaningful for them.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Chitra is working to stay optimistic throughout the new challenges she and her group are navigating. “We’re just continuing to roll with the punches and explore what works. All of us, including our professors, are working to figure it all out as we go, which I guess is the design process!”</p>\n","md":"\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_DVmmfFOIX-j6IWHuSLUBog.jpeg)\n\n_Chitra Anwar is a member of the 2019 cohort of the [Media Design (MA) Program.](https://www.emerson.edu/programs/media-design-ma)\\*\\*\\*\\* She is a first generation Indonesian-American whose experiences as a person and professional spans several states and two countries.

Keeping these populations safe while also maintaining avenues for long-term empowerment are critical as we emerge out of the pandemic into a changed world.</p>\n<p>Education can be one of these avenues for long term empowerment, as demonstrated by <a href=\"http://kenburns.com/college-behind-bars/\">college in prison programs</a> throughout the country. According to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 83% of released state prisoners returned to prison within 9 years of their release, and 44% returned within the first year. According to a Rand Corporation study, educational programming in prisons reduces recidivism by 43%. Beyond highlighting the positive effects of access to education in prisons, these statistics also reflect some of the major challenges of reentry, such as finding employment, re-building relationships with loved ones, and overcoming the stigma of incarceration.</p>\n<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2019, 72% of adults over 25 with a college degree were employed, showcasing the importance of higher education in today’s job market. Therefore, the ability to earn a college degree while in prison better equips returning citizens to compete in the job market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/mneesha-gellman\">Mneesha Gellman,</a> Director of <a href=\"http://epi.emerson.edu/\">Emerson Prison Initiative</a> and Political Science Professor at Emerson College stresses the importance of building an intellectual community through higher education programs, a factor that has become even more important in the wake of Covid-19. While Emerson faculty are no longer able to teach in person, students are continuing to self-facilitate classes, nominating a facilitator and notetaker for discussions. Since MCI Concord, the site for Emerson’s Prison Initiative, is a non-internet prison, students have also shifted towards writing and mailing in all of their assignments. Despite the challenges these shifts present, the intellectual solidarity created within this small cohort of committed students allows the program to continue during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>While the Emerson Prison Initiative is working to support people on the inside, Emerson faculty are participating in other efforts to support people once they are released. Upon reentering society ex-prisoners are stigmatized.

Keeping these populations safe while also maintaining avenues for long-term empowerment are critical as we emerge out of the pandemic into a changed world.\n\nEducation can be one of these avenues for long term empowerment, as demonstrated by [college in prison programs](http://kenburns.com/college-behind-bars/) throughout the country. According to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 83% of released state prisoners returned to prison within 9 years of their release, and 44% returned within the first year. According to a Rand Corporation study, educational programming in prisons reduces recidivism by 43%. Beyond highlighting the positive effects of access to education in prisons, these statistics also reflect some of the major challenges of reentry, such as finding employment, re-building relationships with loved ones, and overcoming the stigma of incarceration.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2019, 72% of adults over 25 with a college degree were employed, showcasing the importance of higher education in today’s job market. Therefore, the ability to earn a college degree while in prison better equips returning citizens to compete in the job market.\n\n[Mneesha Gellman,](https://www.emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/mneesha-gellman) Director of [Emerson Prison Initiative](http://epi.emerson.edu/) and Political Science Professor at Emerson College stresses the importance of building an intellectual community through higher education programs, a factor that has become even more important in the wake of Covid-19. While Emerson faculty are no longer able to teach in person, students are continuing to self-facilitate classes, nominating a facilitator and notetaker for discussions. Since MCI Concord, the site for Emerson’s Prison Initiative, is a non-internet prison, students have also shifted towards writing and mailing in all of their assignments. Despite the challenges these shifts present, the intellectual solidarity created within this small cohort of committed students allows the program to continue during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the Emerson Prison Initiative is working to support people on the inside, Emerson faculty are participating in other efforts to support people once they are released. Upon reentering society ex-prisoners are stigmatized.

In partnership with [Power the Polls](https://www.powerthepolls.org/), they encourage Black women to work the polls and participate in the election process. Their Party in the Mailbox Initiative sends celebratory boxes to homes in Baltimore, Detroit, and Philadelphia with all of the supplies they will need to vote, whether that be absentee or in person.\n\n[**Vote Save America**](https://votesaveamerica.com/)\n\nA by-product of the popular “Pod Save America” podcast, Vote Save America is a one-stop-shop for all things election. In collaboration with campaigns, strategists, and activists, Vote Save America rounds up events, action items, and information on GOTV efforts in each state. Voters can check their registration, get informed on the candidates as well as the political process, and sign up to volunteer at the polls or at a campaign event.\n\nVote Save America also hosts the “Adopt a State Program” which allows volunteers to target their efforts in one of six key swing states. Participants in the Adopt a State Program receive digital organizing training from former campaign staffers, community organizers, and other industry leaders, as well as weekly action items to aid GOTV efforts in their specific state.\n\n[**Mobilize**](https://www.mobilize.us/)\n\nFor both seasoned organizers and newcomers, Mobilize is the easiest way to find campaign events looking for volunteers, and since most events have gone virtual due to the pandemic, you can volunteer in any state or race you feel needs extra support. While many equate organizing with canvassing, phone banking, or other interpersonal activities, Mobilize has events for the introverted or beginner organizer as well, including literature drops or letter-writing events.\n\n[**Vote Forward**](https://votefwd.org/instructions)\n\nVote Forwards allows volunteers to send letters to underrepresented voters with pertinent information on elections around them, as well as instructions on how to vote. Each volunteer receives a digital dashboard upon registration, connecting them to underrepresented voters in key states through targeted campaigns. From there, volunteers can adopt voters, download letter templates, and track their progress. Vote Forward provides volunteers with in-depth instructions every step of the way. The only materials necessary are a blue pen, envelopes, and some stamps.\n\n[**TurboVote**](https://turbovote.org/)\n\nTurboVote focuses on combating misinformation around voting and election procedures while prioritizing data privacy and safety. From facilitating voter registration to tracking absentee voting laws in every state and sending text reminders to voters, TurboVote seeks to increase voter turnout by simplifying the voting process.\n\nThe shift towards digital politicking has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but these organizations show us the positive change that can occur when digital tools meet motivated and engaged citizens, connecting them despite the distance.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2020-10-07T04:00:00Z"},"key":"act-and-advocate-digital-tools-for-the-2020-election","__v":0}

Almost everything has moved to a virtual learning environment with the help of services like Zoom or Google Hangouts. For those in the Media Design program at Emerson College, the whole program has been revamped in order to respond to the challenge of “virtual school”. To learn more, we interviewed a few students in the current cohort to hear about their experience in the program thus far.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you look at design and design processes differently now?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Melody Hsu</strong>: Absolutely. One example of this was when I first applied for the media design program and the pandemic happened. I questioned if I should have deferred for a year. In my head, I was thinking, ‘okay, the learning environment is not going to be ideal’, but at the same time, I realized, well, that’s life, right? You can’t just avoid it and go around an issue when it’s going on. You just have to kind of go through it. So I chose to commit to the Media Design program. I thought that going through the Media Design program itself online during a pandemic would be the biggest media design challenge that we as a cohort would have to face. I feel like this brought us a lot of different experiences that we would not have gotten otherwise, if we just had a “normal semester.”. The way I see classes and the way I see design are different, especially because nowadays when we’re presenting projects ourselves in class, we think about accessibility. This made Miro (an online collaboration platform) become so popular with our cohort because it’s such a good tool to showcase our work. Before the pandemic, we would have gone with something traditional like PowerPoint or something handmade. Now other people who are not in the same room can also access it, which is good. Now we’re always thinking, ‘how do we make this accessible?’ I think that it’s a very valuable experience that we might not necessarily have to troubleshoot and go through trial and error otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Graham Rutherford</strong>: I do. This semester(especially with it being virtual) made me consider access and barriers to entry much more in depth. I’d always considered it before, but having something that’s normally there taken away from you due to forces beyond your control really changes your perspective on things. I’m grateful for the experience because it’s made my “design scope” much broader when I’m putting an idea into place or approaching an issue.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the absence of a physical space change how you implement what you’ve learned regarding design theory?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sydney Angove</strong>: The inability to be in a physical space with the presence of others has prevented growing in some areas of the design process. Collaborating with others is changed when interacting virtually and understanding nonverbal cues that indicate where to adapt practices. I think it will be interesting to see how understanding design through a virtual framework will translate into interacting physically and within communities at the conclusion of the pandemic. Specifically, getting feedback and using visuals together will look much different and take adjusting as a designer. In contrast, I think it has been an enriching experience to face the challenges of virtual learning as a collective. The course of this program thus far has emphasized the importance of being able to adapt and pivot to be successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Drew Genova</strong>: This was extremely troubling. The lack of equipment, resources and help made this semester extremely difficult. I feel like I could have watched youtube tutorials instead.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest challenge of attending classes virtually? Conversely, what’s the biggest benefit?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Grace Fu</strong>: The biggest challenge of having classes virtually is communication. Since we have a lot of conversations and discussions in class, we’d be able to be more productive on-campus. It would be easier to keep eye contact while talking. It is so strange to have classes in this way because everything doesn’t have a feeling. Since we are doing everything online, the quality of the internet connection seems like a basic requirement, but it’s also a very important one. Many times, I need to turn off my video because I cannot see others if I have it on. Background noise is a big problem. When others are talking, the audio sounds really broken up sometimes. One benefit of students taking online classes is we don’t need to get up early, get ready, and go to school. It certainly saves time, but based on my situation (Grace is attending classes virtually from China), I have to have class at night and I don’t like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ramon Montes</strong>: The biggest challenge of attending classes virtually would be the limitation of practicing what you learn and/or talk about in class that could be accomplished in a physical setting. As someone who enjoys learning in school environments, I find it harder to concentrate in my home environment as there are more distractions than I would encounter attending class in a physical setting and completing work on campus. Personally, I find it easier staying on task with my assignments in a learning environment. Therefore, during my undergraduate studies, I would typically schedule my classes with breaks in between to do my work in either a dining hall or study space within the campus. One of the biggest benefits of attending classes virtually would be putting the time usually designated for commuting to better use (whether that is for completing schoolwork, entertainment, or more work hours). Commuting can take a considerable amount of time throughout one’s week. This can definitely be a strong benefit.</p>\n<p>As media designers, the students of this program are no strangers to adapting or restructuring processes. They’ve taken what they were given at the beginning of the semester and treated it as a “design challenge” in itself. Taking things that are normally done in a physical space (interviews, field scans) and considering accessibility offers a new perspective on familiar tasks, and the students are glad to get experience from it.

Lessons on our vulnerability as human beings as well as on our hidden inner strengths. 2020 has been the year of utter chaos, the year that the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 forced us into adopting new ways of living and exposing the gross racial injustices that can no longer be concealed. If there’s anything 2020 has taught us, it is the power of community that manifested itself in the most unusual ways.</p>\n<p>In Spring 2020, Emerson College students from various disciplines partnered with the Nurturing Fatherhood Program at the US Probation Office to connect and amplify stories of fatherhood among Federal Probation Officers and previously incarcerated men. When we were told that our VR &amp; 360 Video Class would be shifted entirely online, it was normal to panic. The fear of working with contaminated devices was on all of our minds. Our partnership with the Nurturing Fatherhood Program had originally meant in-person interactions where we could work collectively in a shared space. However, this quickly changed as we shifted online and our interactions resorted to virtual conversations over Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>These two seemingly disparate groups came together to collectively create a virtual space in which remarkable stories of incarcerated individuals and probation officers who are fathers could be shared through the emerging technology platform. Challenging as it was to communicate with each other and produce a project collectively via remote and online means, more than anything it was rewarding. The level of trust and support everyone had in each other was the reason why we were able to create something so unexpected. Our biggest takeaway from this project is the sense of comradery that was built by everyone involved, which goes back to the power of a strong community, which really is the heart of this project.</p>\n<p>THE PROCESS &amp; CO-CREATION</p>\n<p>Co-creation was at the forefront of this project. Instead of storytellers telling the stories, our focus was on the subjects telling their stories. The fathers were part of the whole production process as well as content providers for the project, which really broke the ice and traditional rules of storytelling. We were able to develop a connection with these fathers. As a result, we have collectively produced a collection of physical and digital postcards, each triggering an audio/visual Augmented Reality (AR), based on the fathers’ shared stories. Our intention was to develop a foundation in immersive storytelling techniques, as well as principles of co-creation and user experience design. The goal was to share stories regarding issues around mass incarceration from multiple perspectives (including data and personal stories) and utilize Augmented Reality (AR) as our platform to tell personal stories that focus on the effects of mass incarceration on families and lower-income communities.</p>\n<p>Even with the shift to online classes, our ambitions were not inhibited. Restricting the class for online collaborations allowed us to achieve new milestones that would have previously been impossible to do in the timeline we had — our shift was fully intentional. As a deliberate decision on professor Rashin Fahandej’s part, she shifted the entire project to Augmented Reality (AR) for accessibility in production as well as the distribution of the work. The decision to switch to AR technology was to make storytelling a dialogue that is happening right in front of you, in real-time. With this close proximity, you are able to listen in on intimate conversations between the fathers and their children. The intention is to tell the story in an embodied form, one in which the viewer is fully immersed in the story. Choosing AR as the platform for these stories makes the experience even more powerful as it bridges the gap between physical reality and the virtual world, reducing the distance between the subject and the witness. While a VR project would require audiences to own a headset, our intentional changeover to AR allowed us to expand our audiences because only a phone would be required, never mind old or new — our project would be accessible.</p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>\n<p>Mehvish Ali is a visual artist who believes in pushing the boundaries of storytelling to create works of art that can move an audience. She is a film buff with a passion for art and music. She loves to draw, sketch, and take pictures of anything that pleases her aesthetically. She is a restless music aficionado — constantly searching for a new song to get obsessed with. She loves the world of fashion and likes to create different styles for herself.

If there’s anything 2020 has taught us, it is the power of community that manifested itself in the most unusual ways.\n\nIn Spring 2020, Emerson College students from various disciplines partnered with the Nurturing Fatherhood Program at the US Probation Office to connect and amplify stories of fatherhood among Federal Probation Officers and previously incarcerated men. When we were told that our VR &amp; 360 Video Class would be shifted entirely online, it was normal to panic. The fear of working with contaminated devices was on all of our minds. Our partnership with the Nurturing Fatherhood Program had originally meant in-person interactions where we could work collectively in a shared space. However, this quickly changed as we shifted online and our interactions resorted to virtual conversations over Zoom calls.\n\nThese two seemingly disparate groups came together to collectively create a virtual space in which remarkable stories of incarcerated individuals and probation officers who are fathers could be shared through the emerging technology platform. Challenging as it was to communicate with each other and produce a project collectively via remote and online means, more than anything it was rewarding. The level of trust and support everyone had in each other was the reason why we were able to create something so unexpected. Our biggest takeaway from this project is the sense of comradery that was built by everyone involved, which goes back to the power of a strong community, which really is the heart of this project.\n\nTHE PROCESS &amp; CO-CREATION\n\nCo-creation was at the forefront of this project. Instead of storytellers telling the stories, our focus was on the subjects telling their stories. The fathers were part of the whole production process as well as content providers for the project, which really broke the ice and traditional rules of storytelling. We were able to develop a connection with these fathers. As a result, we have collectively produced a collection of physical and digital postcards, each triggering an audio/visual Augmented Reality (AR), based on the fathers’ shared stories. Our intention was to develop a foundation in immersive storytelling techniques, as well as principles of co-creation and user experience design. The goal was to share stories regarding issues around mass incarceration from multiple perspectives (including data and personal stories) and utilize Augmented Reality (AR) as our platform to tell personal stories that focus on the effects of mass incarceration on families and lower-income communities.\n\nEven with the shift to online classes, our ambitions were not inhibited. Restricting the class for online collaborations allowed us to achieve new milestones that would have previously been impossible to do in the timeline we had — our shift was fully intentional. As a deliberate decision on professor Rashin Fahandej’s part, she shifted the entire project to Augmented Reality (AR) for accessibility in production as well as the distribution of the work. The decision to switch to AR technology was to make storytelling a dialogue that is happening right in front of you, in real-time. With this close proximity, you are able to listen in on intimate conversations between the fathers and their children. The intention is to tell the story in an embodied form, one in which the viewer is fully immersed in the story. Choosing AR as the platform for these stories makes the experience even more powerful as it bridges the gap between physical reality and the virtual world, reducing the distance between the subject and the witness. While a VR project would require audiences to own a headset, our intentional changeover to AR allowed us to expand our audiences because only a phone would be required, never mind old or new — our project would be accessible.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nMehvish Ali is a visual artist who believes in pushing the boundaries of storytelling to create works of art that can move an audience.

But how can just being connected with people accomplish this? What sort of impact can it have as we strive towards more equitable futures? To better understand this, we reflect on this year’s Social Justice &amp; Media Symposium hosted by Emerson College.</p>\n<p>The Social Justice &amp; Media Symposium has only been around for two years as it was created in the memory of Moses Shumow, who was a media scholar committed to the “power of story to reframe narratives of the marginalized and using media to help people advocate for their rights.” Deeply involved in his community, he worked to ensure that connectivity and impact were felt by everyone he came across. This was reinforced by Rosie Shumow during her opening remarks at the symposium, as she stated that connecting to others was something that was “incredibly important to him.” Out of the five workshops that were conducted that day, one of them was titled “What Impact Can I Have? A Step To Self Understanding.” It focused on creating a plan based on emotional, physical, social, and cognitive capacities and thinking about how to make a commitment to one of them and move forward. This activity was based around thinking about how to use these aspects to engage with social issues and how impactful they can be in connection with others. Since impact was a central theme in the symposium, it’s definitely fitting to participate in an activity that gets people thinking about how they can use aspects of their lives to engage critically in socially equitable practices.</p>\n<p>Embodied media is another critical aspect to consider in terms of how connectivity and impact can be combined to strive towards social equity and justice. This subject was part of keynote speaker <a href=\"https://www.sangitashresthova.com/\">Sangita Shresthova’s</a> presentation. Shresthova discussed the concept of kinesthetic empathy, which is the “practice in which movement and body poses support and relate by helping people connect to each other through non-verbal cues.” Although the event was virtual, she explained that embodiment gives us a sense of connection even if just through a screen. In terms of other social justice events that have happened around the country during the pandemic, this is especially relevant because it has inspired both virtual and in-person protests to happen in the name of justice. That’s the impact that connectivity can have at times, even when we are not sharing the same space.</p>\n<p>At the end of the symposium, the concept of impact had been clearly felt and those in attendance were left with renewed senses of interconnectivity. The setting was different and the symposium itself had to be adapted due to the pandemic, but that didn’t reduce its effectiveness. A community engaging and learning from each other truly embodies the meaning of impact. As event host Paul Mihailidis stated in closing, “it’s not what happens before this and it’s not what happens after this, it’s about coming together and building, sharing, and being present with each other.” To learn more about the symposium itself and Moses Shumow, you can visit the website <a href=\"https://www.sjmsymposium.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n","md":"![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_jvz8aJiR6pL6MWu9O4EvEA.png)\n\n\nMedia can connect people, drive social change, and help bring about equitable futures.

The Civic Media: Art and Practice graduate program, which has now become the Media Design program, brought these partnerships into the classroom and opened up new avenues for the exploration of civic media. Among them is the Journal of Civic Media, an academic journal conceived by the 2019 CMAP cohort and continued by its network of partners. Check out our interview with the journal’s editor Vassiliki Rapti to learn more about the new issue and the history of the journal.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk me through the history of the Journal of Civic Media, its connection to Emerson College’s Engagement Lab, and the Citizen Tales Commons?</strong></p>\n<p>It all started when I joined the Civic Media: Art and Practice program, currently the Media Design program. I was already a professor at Emerson and the program caught my attention since I wanted to try something more innovative. I entered the program with a wonderful cohort of nine people. We were given several opportunities to help the Engagement Lab and to put into practice what we had learned, and among them was to direct the Journal of Civic Media. The Journal was an idea from the leadership at the Lab not only to promote the work that we were doing but also to form bonds among the cohort and allow us to learn from the experience of solving real-world problems. I come from the publishing sector and Emerson’s Writing Program, so I was very interested in this. My colleague Leandra Nielsen and I were co-editors and put together the first issue, a very small issue with four articles on smart cities.</p>\n<p>The Citizen Tales Commons was my thesis project for CMAP. Everything started at the Engagement Lab and ended at the Engagement Lab, so I really want to give back because it was such an amazing and eye-opening experience. We started with 7 people in the pilot program and now we have 85 people, most scholars with PhDs in various disciplines. We formed a collective where we can inspire each other, support each other, and give each other opportunities to thrive while still giving ownership to each member. We work like a Greek chorus, a collective voice that is also led by each expert.</p>\n<p>The central component of the Citizen Tales Commons is the workshops, which would take place weekly at the Engagement Lab and were open to all. I considered the cohort a critical part of the Citizen Tales Commons since they gave constant feedback and support. Three colleagues from my cohort gave workshops — Isaiah Frisbie gave a workshop on empowerment and spoken word poetry, Emily Baeza led a workshop on empowering through the collective and Elisa Hamilton gave a wonderful workshop on participatory methods. We also had people coming in from other universities and really benefited from our partnership with the Ludwig Center. It was a wonderful umbrella of activities that gave us the opportunity to think together about possible alternatives for our current social, cultural and political situations.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you go about re-conceiving the Journal two years after the initial issue was published in 2019? Is the new issue centered on a theme or a specific initiative?</strong></p>\n<p>After we had established some basic guidelines we wanted to do something bigger that would involve everyone in the cohort and would be enhanced with more media and more sections. I was really interested in the idea of civic imagination and was drawn to the program because I wanted to make my life more meaningful and imagine better futures for the world, especially in higher education. Civic imagination then became the theme of the next issue, which is the current issue. There was a big gap between the first issue and the second, due to some Covid and design-related delays, but I am very happy with the new issue. It has 24 articles and we’ve really expanded the fields from which we drew ideas.</p>\n<p>The next issue’s theme is influenced by the pandemic. Because everyone is now doing things via Zoom, Google Meet, or other online mediums and there has been such a huge leap into a new digital era, we want to focus on media in transition. We’re calling the next issue, which will hopefully be ready in the fall, Civic Media in Flux in the Post-Covid19 Era.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your hopes for the future of the Journal of Civic Media and the Citizen Tales Commons, particularly in a post-Covid world? What are new avenues that remote work has opened up and what are activities that still necessitate in-person interactions?</strong></p>\n<p>We really craved the person-to-person interactions. What happened every other week at the Engagement Lab was almost like a ritual and that aspect was really soul-enriching, which has been missing during Covid. My first hope is that we can host in-person meetings at the Engagement Lab again or at a space hosted by one of our other partners. Doing these meetings promotes cross-pollination and keeps the civic imagination alive, which then promotes mobilization and social change. My next hope is to be able to turn the Citizen Tales Commons into a formal organization, which would allow us more financial independence and help us to make the dreams of every participant possible. Currently, we are utilizing and redistributing the resources that each individual member brings to the collective, but non-profit status would allow us to apply for grants and make more impactful changes.</p>\n<p>Zoom meetings allowed us to bring in a lot more members who were not locally based and gave them the opportunity to be more active. It’s not accidental that we increased our membership so much because of the possibilities that Zoom opened up. We had a major collaboration this year at the Emerson Blanquerna Global summit with 8 participants from various countries, including Mexico and Greece. In short, we welcome the challenge. Despite the difficulties of virtual collaboration, it helped us open up more possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk about the expansion of the group from 8 members to 75? How did this affect cross-pollination and the connections between higher ed and other types of partners?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s happening very naturally because every member is so committed to the collective and to the platform that we have that they bring people in. On our website, we have a form that people can fill out, since our collective is open to everyone. They usually come up with a specific project for which they need help, and after we meet with them on Zoom, they are inducted by one of our current members. It’s very tailored and customizable, so we try really hard to find ways to empower them and make possible what they need, whether it be publication, an online presentation or participation in an international conference.</p>\n<p>Our membership is made up mostly of academics, with some artists too, but we have 7 organizations that we’re partnering with currently.

The distribution of this award calls attention to these themes, creating a social awareness that has the potential to drive positive change. We believe that media literacies are central to a society that demands accountability from public institutions, equity for marginalized and underserved communities, and robust opportunities for people to use their voice to advocate for more inclusive futures.

Whether it be interpersonal violence, mass shootings, or in other forms, gun violence continues to appear in our communities and our news cycles. According to <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/\">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, more than 230 Americans are shot and wounded daily, with 100 of those shootings resulting in death. Furthermore, these impacts are magnified, rippling through communities and causing life-long effects on millions of Americans who may witness gun violence, know someone who was shot, or live in fear of the next shooting.</p>\n<p>In January 2020, the Mass General Hospital Center for Gun Violence Prevention sought to tell the stories behind these statistics, highlighting the myriad ways gun violence has lasting effects on the lives of individuals, families, and communities. In partnership with the Emerson Engagement Lab and the MGH Center for Gun Violence Prevention, Emerson College Assistant Professor in Visual Media Arts, Jong Ougie Pak, created a series of short documentaries in which survivors of gun violence speak about their experiences and advocacy. What follows is a Q&amp;A interview with Professor Pak on his creative process and the impact of these stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give some insight into the initial conceptualization of the project? How did Covid19 change the original concept and approach?</strong></p>\n<p>In spring 2020, I heard about the class at a department meeting and thought it seemed interesting. I’m not a documentarian, but I’ve shot and edited a lot of docs for work. I was drawn to the topic of gun violence, especially since my family has been affected firsthand by gun violence, which is something I hadn’t really thought about until this class. I reached out to the department chair and started teaching the class in person, essentially as a small production company.</p>\n<p>I really wanted the students to be the filmmakers, and I was more of an executive producer. They would come in, pursue leads, pitch ideas. They broke into groups of two or three and had lots of different ideas. Producing a documentary in a semester can be difficult, usually, it’s about a year-long process for a ten-minute doc, because often you’re trying to make your connections, gain trust, and conduct research.</p>\n<p>The project was moving forward, then Covid happened. And since a lot of the people we were reaching out to were medical professionals and had much bigger things to worry about, I thought we could either quit or say “hey we’re filmmakers, and even during a pandemic, we’re going to do what we can.” Students were trying their best, but I could tell their leads were dropping. Since I had some of the leads, I began shooting distanced, outside interviews with gun violence survivors, just me, one or two cameras, and wireless mics. I then disseminated that footage out to the students so they could have a hand in editing, and they produced rough cuts or more experimental projects. Whenever you try to make a film, there are constant obstructions, whether it’s money or time or something else. The films became what they were because of the obstructions.</p>\n<p><strong>How is this different from a more traditional film class a student might encounter at Emerson? How does the form, the community, and the topic influence the pedagogy and process, particularly when it comes to building trust with communities?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest thing with documentaries is access and trust. You can’t make a documentary about someone who doesn’t want the documentary made. So the first thing I did was find people who were already speaking about gun violence because they have stories they want to tell. Then the documentarian comes in almost as a medium to put their story on film, whatever that may mean. It’s impossible to force someone to be in a movie. It can be a very uncomfortable thing for people, so having an open, ready, and willing subject is the first step. After that, then the filmmaker has to be an open, honest and responsible person who the subject can trust to tell their story.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the process of finding subjects like? Are there any additional challenges you encountered? How did the subjects influence the project?</strong></p>\n<p>To start with we had a lot of contacts, through MGH, through community organizations in Jamaica Plain and Roxbury, and I really pushed students to pursue their own leads and interests. Finding leads wasn’t hard because there were already a lot of organizations doing work on gun violence, which have made video media with a similar mission. We then had to ask the question: What did we want to make that hadn’t been made before? There have already been so many PSAs made, and there was a consensus to not make something that’s already been done. The main element that was of interest to all of us was the human element. We all know the facts and figures on gun violence, but the one thing film can do is show the intimate, human stories behind the facts and figures. What does it mean to one person? To one family?</p>\n<p><strong>How did you get down to the four final subjects? Is there any kind of connecting thread between them?</strong></p>\n<p>There were various factors I considered, like how long ago their experience was, how directly they were impacted. The stories that we honed in on ended up being two subjects that were shot themselves and survived.I thought that was crazy, what is it like to almost die and then survive? The two other subjects were mothers who had lost their sons to gun violence. If we’re going to talk about gun violence in America, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, we have to tell that story, even though it’s been done many times in many different places. I couldn’t imagine making a series on survivors and not touching on that aspect. That process also happened organically based on who I was able to get in touch with through various organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>These are incredibly personal and emotional stories, how did you continue to build trust with your subjects?</strong></p>\n<p>I really like Errol Morris as a documentarian. He has so many wonderful films, like this series called First Person where it’s just people telling their own stories. I thought about doing something like that, especially since they were distanced interviews due to Covid. If I could just be a medium and put the story they are telling on film effectively, then that’s it. I wanted to keep it really simple, focus on making them comfortable, and allowing them to tell their own stories.</p>\n<p>I’m very interested in people and their stories, and I’m also pretty open to talking about my own experiences, so we really just had conversations. Each one of the subjects had very different socioeconomic backgrounds, different class, race. I grew up around a lot of different people and am comfortable talking to lots of different people. It was crazy to me that they all experienced the same thing even though their lives are so different. That’s how it is in America, it doesn’t matter who you are, you could get shot and killed. I keep in touch with all of the subjects and found their stories fascinating. I’m glad they’ve all liked the videos, and I hope it does their story justice.</p>\n<p>When we were first approached by MGH, the doctors kept asking what the faces behind gun violence really looked like. What was the experience of actual gun violence survivors? And I feel like we effectively showed the stories of a few real survivors of gun violence. That’s as simple as it gets.</p>\n","md":"![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_G-o_qj0VtANTTlQFpoCCDA.png)\n\n\nEvery year, Americans are impacted by gun violence in a variety of ways.

There have already been so many PSAs made, and there was a consensus to not make something that’s already been done. The main element that was of interest to all of us was the human element. We all know the facts and figures on gun violence, but the one thing film can do is show the intimate, human stories behind the facts and figures. What does it mean to one person? To one family?\n\n**How did you get down to the four final subjects? Is there any kind of connecting thread between them?**\n\nThere were various factors I considered, like how long ago their experience was, how directly they were impacted. The stories that we honed in on ended up being two subjects that were shot themselves and survived.I thought that was crazy, what is it like to almost die and then survive? The two other subjects were mothers who had lost their sons to gun violence. If we’re going to talk about gun violence in America, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, we have to tell that story, even though it’s been done many times in many different places. I couldn’t imagine making a series on survivors and not touching on that aspect. That process also happened organically based on who I was able to get in touch with through various organizations.\n\n**These are incredibly personal and emotional stories, how did you continue to build trust with your subjects?**\n\nI really like Errol Morris as a documentarian. He has so many wonderful films, like this series called First Person where it’s just people telling their own stories. I thought about doing something like that, especially since they were distanced interviews due to Covid. If I could just be a medium and put the story they are telling on film effectively, then that’s it. I wanted to keep it really simple, focus on making them comfortable, and allowing them to tell their own stories.\n\nI’m very interested in people and their stories, and I’m also pretty open to talking about my own experiences, so we really just had conversations. Each one of the subjects had very different socioeconomic backgrounds, different class, race. I grew up around a lot of different people and am comfortable talking to lots of different people. It was crazy to me that they all experienced the same thing even though their lives are so different. That’s how it is in America, it doesn’t matter who you are, you could get shot and killed. I keep in touch with all of the subjects and found their stories fascinating. I’m glad they’ve all liked the videos, and I hope it does their story justice.\n\nWhen we were first approached by MGH, the doctors kept asking what the faces behind gun violence really looked like. What was the experience of actual gun violence survivors? And I feel like we effectively showed the stories of a few real survivors of gun violence. That’s as simple as it gets.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2021-02-12T05:00:00Z"},"key":"mgh-gun-violence-prevention-series-an-interview-with-ougie-pak","__v":0}

They, along with the rest of the [MIML team](https://mappingimpactfulml.org/team/), conducted 27 in-depth interviews with media literacy stakeholders across the country to understand contemporary practices having that impact.

Teen Empowerment recently released <a href=\"https://teenempowerment.org/senseless-smoke/\">Senseless Smoke</a>, an original film about a community coping with the aftermath of gun violence.</p>\n<p>Teen Empowerment’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SenselessSmoke%20&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\">#SenselessSmoke</a> campaign aims to “Promote Peace Through the Power of the People” using the arts as a tool for social change.</p>\n<p>Emerging technologies are offering new means of narrative change and self-expression. <a href=\"http://ericjgordon.net/\">Dr. Eric Gordon</a> spoke about the potential of these technologies and the dire need to put them in the hands of communities that have important stories to tell.</p>\n<p>“We will imagine new narrative structures, new distribution strategies, new organizational interventions, and new data visualizations to substantially alter how we talk and think about the impact of guns in our city and surrounding communities.”</p>\n<p>Interim President of Emerson College Dr. William Gilligan spoke on the institutional responsibility Emerson College has to its neighbors, amplifying those stories and resources of communities disproportionately targeted by institutional oppression. The Engagement Lab, Dr. Gilligan said, is a major way Emerson College supports innovative civic engagement strategies and social responsibility.</p>\n<p>The Gun Violence Initiative is not just changing how we see the institutional role Boston universities have to play in civic life, but also the many healthcare institutions that benefit so much from the city in which they are located.</p>\n<p>As co-director for Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Gun Violence Prevention, <a href=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17132/peter-masiakos\">Dr. Peter Masiakos</a> sees how the stories we tell about gun violence prevent us from properly addressing its root causes.</p>\n<p>“What does get reported skewed towards senseless acts of terror, with the blame placed squarely on the shoulders of a mentally ill monster. The gun violence in the United States is not primarily a mental health problem, it is however, a public health epidemic.”</p>\n<p>Clinicians see not only the direct harm guns cause, but the rippling effects of chronic pain, anxiety, and trauma that reverberate through the communities closest to this epidemic. Where those communities are excluded from interventions into gun violence prevention and response, interventions fail. Where those communities lead, amazing things happen.</p>\n<p>MGH President Dr. David Brown, agrees. “The names Columbine sandy hook parkland and pulse nightclub are synonymous with gun violence,” he said following Dr. Masiakos’ remarks “but what can we learn from the more than 95% of gunshot deaths that are not part of a mass shooting or some other high profile event.”</p>\n<p>Boston City Councilor <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/city-council/andrea-campbell\">Andrea Campbell</a> represents district 4, where the <a href=\"https://www.ldbpeaceinstitute.org/\">Louis D. Brown Peace Institute</a> has been a center of families impacted by murder, trauma, grief, and loss to heal, teach, and learn together.</p>\n<p>“… in government, we often need to get out of the way,” Councilor Cambel said, “and allow those who know what they’re doing to lead the way… for us in positions of power and elected office… to support the work, to collaborate and to scale up the incredible ideas that come out of such initiatives.”</p>\n<p>&gt; Proud to join @EngageLab @MGH_GVPC @LDBpeaceInst to launch the Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence initiative.

Brown Peace Institute](https://www.ldbpeaceinstitute.org/) and the [Center for Gun Violence Prevention](https://www.massgeneral.org/gun-violence-prevention) at Massachusetts General Hospital, launched the 2021 [Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence Initiative](https://www.transformnarratives.org/).\n\n[The launch](https://www.transformnarratives.org/event) began with a poem by Breezy Bodden from [Teen Empowerment Studios](https://teenempowerment.org/). Teen Empowerment recently released [Senseless Smoke](https://teenempowerment.org/senseless-smoke/), an original film about a community coping with the aftermath of gun violence.\n\nTeen Empowerment’s [#SenselessSmoke](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SenselessSmoke%20&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top) campaign aims to “Promote Peace Through the Power of the People” using the arts as a tool for social change.\n\nEmerging technologies are offering new means of narrative change and self-expression. [Dr. Eric Gordon](http://ericjgordon.net/) spoke about the potential of these technologies and the dire need to put them in the hands of communities that have important stories to tell.\n\n“We will imagine new narrative structures, new distribution strategies, new organizational interventions, and new data visualizations to substantially alter how we talk and think about the impact of guns in our city and surrounding communities.”\n\nInterim President of Emerson College Dr. William Gilligan spoke on the institutional responsibility Emerson College has to its neighbors, amplifying those stories and resources of communities disproportionately targeted by institutional oppression. The Engagement Lab, Dr. Gilligan said, is a major way Emerson College supports innovative civic engagement strategies and social responsibility.\n\nThe Gun Violence Initiative is not just changing how we see the institutional role Boston universities have to play in civic life, but also the many healthcare institutions that benefit so much from the city in which they are located.\n\nAs co-director for Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Gun Violence Prevention, [Dr. Peter Masiakos](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17132/peter-masiakos) sees how the stories we tell about gun violence prevent us from properly addressing its root causes.\n\n“What does get reported skewed towards senseless acts of terror, with the blame placed squarely on the shoulders of a mentally ill monster. The gun violence in the United States is not primarily a mental health problem, it is however, a public health epidemic.”\n\nClinicians see not only the direct harm guns cause, but the rippling effects of chronic pain, anxiety, and trauma that reverberate through the communities closest to this epidemic. Where those communities are excluded from interventions into gun violence prevention and response, interventions fail. Where those communities lead, amazing things happen.\n\nMGH President Dr. David Brown, agrees. “The names Columbine sandy hook parkland and pulse nightclub are synonymous with gun violence,” he said following Dr. Masiakos’ remarks “but what can we learn from the more than 95% of gunshot deaths that are not part of a mass shooting or some other high profile event.”\n\nBoston City Councilor [Andrea Campbell](https://www.boston.gov/departments/city-council/andrea-campbell) represents district 4, where the [Louis D. Brown Peace Institute](https://www.ldbpeaceinstitute.org/) has been a center of families impacted by murder, trauma, grief, and loss to heal, teach, and learn together.\n\n“… in government, we often need to get out of the way,” Councilor Cambel said, “and allow those who know what they’re doing to lead the way… for us in positions of power and elected office… to support the work, to collaborate and to scale up the incredible ideas that come out of such initiatives.”\n\n&gt; Proud to join @EngageLab @MGH_GVPC @LDBpeaceInst to launch the Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence initiative. TY for lifting up so many powerful voices and experiences! https://t.co/DiyjG9SVPn\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreaforboston/status/1466858265686560777\">@andreaforboston</a></p>\n\nAssociate Program Coordinator for Teen Empowerment Willington Vuelto, plays creative and administrative roles in generating those ideas. As a musician and actor, he shared how he is helping reshape narratives of gun violence through mediums and communication design. Similarly, [last year’s partnered studio](https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/mgh-gun-violence-prevention-series-an-interview-with-ougie-pak-78d9294b50d1) led by [Ougie Pak](https://www.emerson.edu/faculty-staff-directory/jong-ougie-pak) produced a [video](https://vimeo.com/552024774) about Clarissa Turner losing her son to gun violence.\n\n[Chaplain Clementina M. Chéry](https://www.chaplainchery.com/) co-founded the Louis D. Brown Peace Institute in 1994 after her son, for whom the institute is named, also died from gun violence. He was killed while on his way to a group meeting for teens against gang violence. Chaplain Chéry remembered the condolences she received were full resignation and condescension about what happens in “these communities.”\n\n“This was my ammunition to change the narrative,” she said, “from people seeing us as a community where bad things happen, to a community of [assets](https://www.ldbpeaceinstitute.org/best-practices-for-serving-survivors-of-homicide-victims/), a community where families live to raise their children.”\n\n28 years later, the place where her son Louis is still considered dangerous, a “hot spot.” Transforming Boston’s response to gun violence has been slow, but she and her community have made progress. Victims' networks, compassionate governmental support, and equitable rapid response tools are chipping away at this intractable problem and making real differences in people’s lives.\n\nThe Gun Violence Initiative opens a new chapter in this work, directly challenging internalized and externalized narratives of gun violence that get in the way of efficiently and preemptively distributing resources that can prevent violence and support victims when violence happens.\n\n&gt; \"#Boston prides itself in being the leader with the strongest gun laws... this partnership will make Boston the leader in transforming narratives of gun violence.\"An anchor and a force for so many of us @ChaplainChery @LDBpeaceInst #generationpeace #transformingnarratives\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngageLab/status/1466492641147858948\">@EngageLab</a></p>\n\nOther speakers at th launch event included Co-director of Mass General’sCenter for Gun Violence Prevention [Dr. Chana Sacks](https://advances.massgeneral.org/contributors/contributor.aspx?id=1610), Boston musician [Caleb McCoy](https://soundcloud.com/caleb-mccoy/popular-tracks), and [Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley](https://ayannapressley.com/), who called in to the launch event from the house floor in between votes.\n\n“What this gun violence leaves in its wake,” Representative Pressley said, “so much of this is really rooted in systemic racism and decades of what I would characterize as policy violence… Underinvestment, disinvestment in the same communities that have been disproportionately impacted by this public health crisis.”\n\nCongresswoman Ayanna Pressley has been fighting to scale gun licensing laws across the nation and set aside money in the build back better act community-based violence prevention efforts, and trauma recovery centers.\n\n“But the work does not begin in Congress,” she said. “It begins in community, with partnerships, like the one that we’re launching today.”\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_HFfN2Fr1ZI8-jHhsVZiUvA.jpeg)\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2021-12-04T05:00:00Z"},"key":"introducing-the-transforming-narratives-of-gun-violence-initiative","__v":0}

The two of them remained in touch after Johnny’s graduation and their connection led to the beginning of Johnny’s journey at the eLab. Johnny joined the eLab as the Lead Developer because of his love for the Emerson community and the type of work that the eLab had been doing. His past experience working in the gaming industry informs Johnny’s approach to problem-solving through play and tech to build better democracy and governance. Johnny saw firsthand the changes that the eLab and the Emerson community have gone through over the past decade. Since he graduated from Emerson 13 years ago, the campus has undergone drastic transformations alongside Boston’s changing environment. The eLab has also constantly been evolving and improving in this journey. Currently, Johnny is focused on the new initiative <a href=\"https://www.transformnarratives.org/\">Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence (TNGV)</a> and assisting the team with his technology expertise. His goal for the eLab is to be able to incorporate more automation pipelines into the eLab workflow so that the <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/\">eLab website</a> can quickly reflect project updates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_vjvKQqWjx63uINKa.jpeg\" alt=\"Anne Cahill, Director of Finance &amp; Grants\"></p>\n<p>Anne joined the eLab in 2016 through a friend’s referral. She is fond of the social justice and local community-related research that the eLab focuses on.

She enjoys the eLab’s intimate and hands-on environment where she can see the impact of her work. Her main responsibilities include approving all eLab purchases and ensuring that they all go to the correct fund. This process can be challenging at times because of potential communication issues. But using communication tools like Slack and emails allows Anne to stay organized.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_HwozkoaHK7mq8QHI.jpeg\" alt=\"Rachele Gardner, Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Civic Impact, Engagement Lab &amp; Lead Organizer, People’s Collaborative Governance Network\"></p>\n<p>Rachele came to the eLab with deep experience of Boston’s civic and non-profit sector. In 2019, as the lead organizer of the <a href=\"https://bostoncivicleaderssummit.com/\">2019 Boston Civic Leaders Summit</a>, she invited our eLab director Eric Gordon to be a panelist. After this event, Rachele and Eric continued their discussions around the urgent need to support community-led change-making in Boston. Later on, they received the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to explore mechanisms of collaborative governance in 2020. This led to the establishment of the People’s Collaborative Governance Network (PCGN), which focuses on how local government can partner with communities to transform policy and services in Boston. As the one-year grant began to wrap up, Eric invited her to stay on at the eLab as the Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Civic Impact to help continue this model of initiatives.</p>\n<p>Rachele describes her personal mission as working to create greater equity in Boston by equipping and empowering youth and adult residents as drivers for change in their own communities. Rachele lives this mission at eLab, working closely with community-based partners, Emerson faculty and staff, and other stakeholders to ensure that those who are most directly impacted by the issues and projects explored at eLab remain centralized in the work.

The two of them remained in touch after Johnny’s graduation and their connection led to the beginning of Johnny’s journey at the eLab. Johnny joined the eLab as the Lead Developer because of his love for the Emerson community and the type of work that the eLab had been doing. His past experience working in the gaming industry informs Johnny’s approach to problem-solving through play and tech to build better democracy and governance. Johnny saw firsthand the changes that the eLab and the Emerson community have gone through over the past decade. Since he graduated from Emerson 13 years ago, the campus has undergone drastic transformations alongside Boston’s changing environment. The eLab has also constantly been evolving and improving in this journey. Currently, Johnny is focused on the new initiative [Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence (TNGV)](https://www.transformnarratives.org/) and assisting the team with his technology expertise. His goal for the eLab is to be able to incorporate more automation pipelines into the eLab workflow so that the [eLab website](https://elab.emerson.edu/) can quickly reflect project updates.\n\n![Anne Cahill, Director of Finance &amp; Grants](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_vjvKQqWjx63uINKa.jpeg)\n\nAnne joined the eLab in 2016 through a friend’s referral. She is fond of the social justice and local community-related research that the eLab focuses on. Anne brings 18 years of work experience in Boston higher education at institutions like Harvard University and MIT to her role as Director of Finance &amp; Grants at the eLab. She enjoys the eLab’s intimate and hands-on environment where she can see the impact of her work. Her main responsibilities include approving all eLab purchases and ensuring that they all go to the correct fund. This process can be challenging at times because of potential communication issues. But using communication tools like Slack and emails allows Anne to stay organized.\n\n![Rachele Gardner, Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Civic Impact, Engagement Lab &amp; Lead Organizer, People’s Collaborative Governance Network](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_HwozkoaHK7mq8QHI.jpeg)\n\nRachele came to the eLab with deep experience of Boston’s civic and non-profit sector. In 2019, as the lead organizer of the [2019 Boston Civic Leaders Summit](https://bostoncivicleaderssummit.com/), she invited our eLab director Eric Gordon to be a panelist. After this event, Rachele and Eric continued their discussions around the urgent need to support community-led change-making in Boston. Later on, they received the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to explore mechanisms of collaborative governance in 2020. This led to the establishment of the People’s Collaborative Governance Network (PCGN), which focuses on how local government can partner with communities to transform policy and services in Boston. As the one-year grant began to wrap up, Eric invited her to stay on at the eLab as the Manager of Strategic Partnerships and Civic Impact to help continue this model of initiatives.\n\nRachele describes her personal mission as working to create greater equity in Boston by equipping and empowering youth and adult residents as drivers for change in their own communities. Rachele lives this mission at eLab, working closely with community-based partners, Emerson faculty and staff, and other stakeholders to ensure that those who are most directly impacted by the issues and projects explored at eLab remain centralized in the work. Rachele’s role in the eLab’s TNGV initiative is to facilitate community involvement and leadership as well as determine how to measure direct social impact. She envisions that the eLab will incorporate more initiatives like TNGV in the next few years, allowing the eLab to become a pioneer among other academic institutions in community engagement and partnerships. Rachele also hopes that the eLab can be a space for Emerson students to use art, communications, and media for social justice issues in the long term.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2022-02-10T05:00:00Z"},"key":"introducing-elab-staff-members-rachele-johnny-and-anne","__v":0}

This is a film written, created, and starred by staff and youth from the Center for Teen Empowerment in Roxbury. The youth, having been exposed themselves to the effects of violence within their communities, bring authenticity to the characters and voices, both raising awareness of the systemic conditions that allow gun violence to take root, and also demonstrating the power within the community to transform itself and bring peace. The film exposes and critiques the systems that perpetuate conditions of mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and gangs that continue to challenge black and brown communities’ ability to thrive, while also calling the same communities to collective action. These young actors and actresses displayed incredible courage, strength, and talent as they immersed themselves in the complex characters and conditions of the film, much to the benefit of viewers.</p>\n<p>Teen Empowerment created this film as part of its anti-violence arts advocacy programming. As such, they create viewing experiences of the film that include post-viewing “talkbacks” with the youth cast to go deeper into some of the themes and content with the audience. Recently, the Elma Lewis Center hosted a viewing and talkback with Teen Empowerment at Emerson. This recent interaction at Emerson of having creators, actors, students, professors and community members engaging in a single conversation about gun violence was extraordinary — a process in which questions and answers come from those voices of our community dealing directly with and most affected by gun violence. As Emerson students engaged in discussion with the youth cast of the film, there was a genuine curiosity to better understand the youths’ perspectives of the problem. This is a critical first step to being allies in the work of social change and healing. And one we’re committed to as students in the <a href=\"https://www.transformnarratives.org/\">Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence</a> initiative.</p>\n<p>During the talkback following the film, someone in the Emerson audience asked the youth actors and adult staff to speak to their experiences making the film and entering into their characters. Robert, the films’ director, and art director at Teen Empowerment spoke about supporting each actor and actress’ unique process of stepping outside of themselves to take on their character, to reflect, and then provide what is needed to fulfill a desired mood or characteristic that might not come naturally. Helping the youth grow as actors and bring their characters to life on the screen was his biggest success. One of the young male actors described his process, explaining that he had to set himself aside from the others and enter into a real dark place in his mind to fulfill his role in the film. One of the young actresses who played an elder in the community, “triple her age,” said that the film gave her a reason to spend more time with her grandmother to enter into the mindset of an elder. In doing so, she said that she learned that many of the issues they are dealing with today as teens, their elders also dealt with, just in slightly different forms, void of technology. When asked what they learned from their characters, another actor answered that he learned from his character’s ability to transition from being part of the problem to part of the solution — we all have a role to play. When asked if there would be a sequel to the film? They were all hopeful, provided there were resources to support its production.</p>\n<p>For any who have not yet viewed the film and experienced a talkback with the youth cast, we recommend you take the next opportunity to do so. Teen Empowerment is creating authentic spaces for all to engage with the complex issues related to gun violence and to see themselves as part of the solution to transform the narrative. As the young actor suggested, if stepping outside of yourself and into a dark place allows you the development needed to create the best results, then this film shows us exactly where this dark place is, and it is not one void of hope.</p>\n","md":"\nWritten by John Yang\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1/homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_Acu4h2XXOdZonnZ2t8whUw.png)\n\n[Senseless smoke](https://teenempowerment.org/senseless-smoke/) is a movie created to uplift unheard voices of those affected by gun violence in places that have become silent in how their stories are told.

As such, they create viewing experiences of the film that include post-viewing “talkbacks” with the youth cast to go deeper into some of the themes and content with the audience. Recently, the Elma Lewis Center hosted a viewing and talkback with Teen Empowerment at Emerson. This recent interaction at Emerson of having creators, actors, students, professors and community members engaging in a single conversation about gun violence was extraordinary — a process in which questions and answers come from those voices of our community dealing directly with and most affected by gun violence. As Emerson students engaged in discussion with the youth cast of the film, there was a genuine curiosity to better understand the youths’ perspectives of the problem. This is a critical first step to being allies in the work of social change and healing. And one we’re committed to as students in the [Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence](https://www.transformnarratives.org/) initiative.\n\nDuring the talkback following the film, someone in the Emerson audience asked the youth actors and adult staff to speak to their experiences making the film and entering into their characters. Robert, the films’ director, and art director at Teen Empowerment spoke about supporting each actor and actress’ unique process of stepping outside of themselves to take on their character, to reflect, and then provide what is needed to fulfill a desired mood or characteristic that might not come naturally. Helping the youth grow as actors and bring their characters to life on the screen was his biggest success. One of the young male actors described his process, explaining that he had to set himself aside from the others and enter into a real dark place in his mind to fulfill his role in the film. One of the young actresses who played an elder in the community, “triple her age,” said that the film gave her a reason to spend more time with her grandmother to enter into the mindset of an elder. In doing so, she said that she learned that many of the issues they are dealing with today as teens, their elders also dealt with, just in slightly different forms, void of technology. When asked what they learned from their characters, another actor answered that he learned from his character’s ability to transition from being part of the problem to part of the solution — we all have a role to play. When asked if there would be a sequel to the film? They were all hopeful, provided there were resources to support its production.\n\nFor any who have not yet viewed the film and experienced a talkback with the youth cast, we recommend you take the next opportunity to do so. Teen Empowerment is creating authentic spaces for all to engage with the complex issues related to gun violence and to see themselves as part of the solution to transform the narrative. As the young actor suggested, if stepping outside of yourself and into a dark place allows you the development needed to create the best results, then this film shows us exactly where this dark place is, and it is not one void of hope.\n"},"datePosted":{"$date":"2022-03-24T04:00:00Z"},"key":"promoting-peace-through-the-power-of-the-people","__v":0}
