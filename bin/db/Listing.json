Water is added or subtracted from the cups with sponges, and players are asked to predict the final level. Players earn game currency by reporting the water level, weather, and other real-time information about their local area. They can earn more by placing bets about future conditions. The farther out their predictions, and more accurate their guesses, the larger the reward. To help make more accurate guesses, players may also purchase information about what players upstream from them are reporting, or buy access to a computer model. In the end, the player who is best able to leverage this information into accurate predictions will be deemed the winner.","indexed":true,"archived":false,"bgImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y","version":1599233704,"signature":"d638c31942d513e45bb843c9e12752f97a159500","width":6001,"height":1451,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y.png"},"endYear":"2014","initiatives":[],"partners":[{"$oid":"5f4c51e8885c3c56ca643df4"}],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk","version":1599233704,"signature":"52d7651fe67ea5271afafdd3af3ffdec65011cae","width":720,"height":540,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk.png"},"primaryImageDescription":"","projectLeads":["Eric Gordon"],"publications":[{"$oid":"591a0ffb924dcc26760e7254"}],"startYear":"2013","status":"Completed","teamMembers":[]}

The study found that technologies used by non-profits often end up not reaching their intended impact. Instead they exacerbate the already limited capacity of the organization and force a different style of communication. We identified a distinction between functional and representational uses of tech: functional is what the tech is designed to do, and representational is how people talk about the tech. We found that the representational value had a much more lasting impact on the community and the organization than did the functional value. ","strategyTxt":"Enter the Habit@ project, conceived as a means of testing whether deploying a cluster of tools through a sustained community engagement might prove more effective than a one-off experiment. The Lab worked closely for 10 months with a community development corporation (CDC) in a Boston neighborhood to test the impact of a series of digital and offline tools for participatory planning on the community. Simultaneously, the lab conducted an organizational ethnography of the CDC to help them better understand their capacity in the area of communications and technology.","indexed":true,"archived":false,"endYear":"2014","initiatives":[{"$oid":"5c096ca9d950c730b98c28ae"}],"partners":[],"primaryImageDescription":"","projectLeads":[],"publications":[],"startYear":"2013","status":"Completed","teamMembers":[],"bgImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05","version":1599183846,"signature":"3061cd29f7b1ea63fed84722c9b54484a05dcf1d","width":1452,"height":906,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05.png"},"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc","version":1599183846,"signature":"87b48e3f99f070b3b5ee32423399ace4bf76865a","width":1600,"height":1196,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc.png"}}

In the year leading up to the 2018 Hackathon, the research team conducted applied qualitative and quantitative research with low-income women to understand the triumphs and challenges of feeding their babies. These digital stories and follow-up interviews resonated nationwide with women from diverse demographics and helped ensure that hackathon designs and ideas were inclusive. This initiative was developed with support by the MIT Center for Civic Media and made possible by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Medela, as well as corporate sponsors. The Breast Pump Hackathon has been featured in Slate, Vogue, The Atlantic, and The Boston Globe.","strategyTxt":"To address these issues, the Hackathon included a variety of events and spaces; it was a design sprint for designers, engineers, parents, and health care providers. The Make Family Leave Not Suck Policy Summit acted as a convening for national thought leaders on paid family leave policy. The Innovators Gallery was an exhibitor space with 25 top breastfeeding tech companies such as Medela and EvenFlo. There was also an art exhibition showcasing artwork related to breastfeeding and pumping. And perhaps most importantly, there was the Baby Village, a space for babies and parents to chill and get massages. There was also a “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon. Participants in the accelerator represent people who have not traditionally been involved in hackathons but who were already talented innovators and advocates for low-income families in their communities. The 2018 Hackathon also recognized that the future is intersectional. Working with equity expert Jennifer Roberts and the Office of Diversity and Student Support at the Media Lab, Historically Black Colleges and Universities helped support the participation of undergraduate students in the hackathon and policy summit.\r\nThere was also a  “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon.

The curriculum was facilitated in 10 intervention schools between 9 and 30 March 2017, and 10 additional schools, which did not receive the curriculum, were used as a comparison group. Schools were randomly assigned to groups. Lack of handwashing infrastructure was a criteria for inclusion in the study. All 20 schools were equipped with two Tippy Tap stations with two Tippy Taps each prior to baseline. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, two weeks post-intervention (posttest 1), and 15 weeks post-intervention (posttest 2). Measurements included surveys delivered orally to children, structured\r\nobservations of Tippy Taps, structured observations of the curriculum being implemented, focus group discussions immediately following intervention in the treatment group, and sensors and cameras mounted to Tippy Taps to count handwashing events.  \r\n\r\nHandwashing with Ananse has shown to be an effective intervention in several important ways: changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior led to a significant decrease in self-reported illness of 8.2% more than the comparison group at posttest 2.

Where do I find the room code?</h2>\n<p>A room code is a unique string of letters that allows users to connect to a specific game with one another. The game code can be found in two places. First, the game code can be found on the educator’s main screen (game lobby) before gameplay begins. You can also look at the URL of the game lobby. The last four capitalized letters in the URL is the room code. </p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-play-this-with-players-in-different-classrooms-or-classroom-versus-classroom-\">Can I play this with players in different classrooms or classroom versus classroom?</h2>\n<p>Yes, By using streaming services like Twitch or screen sharing services like google hangout, you can play with people from all over the world as long as they have an internet connection. </p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-play-with-more-than-eight-players-\">Can I play with more than eight players?</h2>\n<p>No, but see the question below for ways to incorporate more players into the experience. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-play-this-in-the-classroom-if-only-eight-students-can-play-\">How can I play this in the classroom if only eight students can play?</h2>\n<p>We are working on additional features that will allow more students to participate in an active way. But even with only eight active players, there are many ways to incorporate entire classrooms into the experience in many different ways. Emerging Citizens at its core is an attempt to bridge the gap between “traditional” learning and new modes of interaction, and so finding ways to combine these two approaches is at the heart of the experience! Here are some suggestions we have. If you have your own way of using Emerging Citizens, please let us know!</p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions on how to engage larger groups of students. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have your students team up in pairs. </li>\n<li>Alternately, have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the other student vote. </li>\n<li>Form groups and for each round, have one student act as the “leader.”</li>\n<li>Or, form groups and have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the group vote together. </li>\n<li>Educators can also create an analog point bonus question system. Add opportunities for additional bonus points by asking questions in-between rounds to the students who are not playing. They then can award those earned points to their “champion” (who is an active player). </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-create-my-own-content-to-use-in-the-game-\">Can I create my own content to use in the game?</h2>\n<p>Though we will be supporting this feature in the future, we currently don’t have the ability for a facilitator to create their own content.

Emerging Citizens requires real-time communication between multiple devices in order to play.\r\n- Are you behind a firewall, network filter, or using anti-virus software that blocks the use of web sockets? Emerging Citizens uses sockets to function, so ensure that they are open on your network or check with your IT administrator.\r\n- Is your device/operating system/browser supported? Check the list above to make sure you’re playing on a supported platform and that your software is up-to-date. \r\n- Are you playing in “Incognito” or other private-browsing modes? These browser modes can interfere with the connection between a device and the game. \r\n\r\n## What happens if I close out the window with the main screen? \r\nIf the main screen is refreshed or closed, all players will be disconnected from the session and the game will end.\r\n\r\n## I accidently closed my player screen browser window. Can I rejoin?\r\nUnfortunately, if the browser window is closed, the device becomes permanently disconnected from the session. \r\n\r\n## I put my phone to sleep. Can I rejoin? \r\nTry refreshing your browser window. You should see a message that says “resuming your session.” You might need to wait until the end of the current round before you rejoin the game.\r\n\r\n## Can I play using low-power mode?\r\nIf your phone is in low power mode, we cannot keep your device awake during the game. We encourage you to remind players to disable low power mode in their devices’ settings or plug in their devices before the game begins.\r\n\r\n## Why is my device telling me that the emerging citizens site, and other associated sites are unsafe?\r\nThis is just a security certificate problem. You can progress to the website by selecting Advanced options and clicking the link to proceed to the website. Please know that we value your privacy and we will at no time be saving your data or asking for your data.\r\n\r\n## How do players win? \r\nEach of Emerging Citizens’ games are point-based. The player with the most points wins! \r\n\r\nIn Wikigeeks, players win points based on how quickly they can navigate to the target article, and how many clicks it takes them to reach there. [Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/wikigeeks)\r\n\r\nIn Hashtag You’re It, points are acquired through tricking players into choosing their hashtag as well as guessing the correct hashtag for the tweet portrayed on the screen.[ Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/htyi)\r\n\r\nIn Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me, players win points by having their memes voted for by other players. [Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/wwdmm)\r\n\r\n## What is a room code? Where do I find the room code?\r\nA room code is a unique string of letters that allows users to connect to a specific game with one another. The game code can be found in two places. First, the game code can be found on the educator’s main screen (game lobby) before gameplay begins. You can also look at the URL of the game lobby. The last four capitalized letters in the URL is the room code. \r\n\r\n## Can I play this with players in different classrooms or classroom versus classroom?\r\nYes, By using streaming services like Twitch or screen sharing services like google hangout, you can play with people from all over the world as long as they have an internet connection. \r\n\r\n## Can I play with more than eight players?\r\nNo, but see the question below for ways to incorporate more players into the experience. \r\n\r\n## How can I play this in the classroom if only eight students can play? \r\nWe are working on additional features that will allow more students to participate in an active way. But even with only eight active players, there are many ways to incorporate entire classrooms into the experience in many different ways. Emerging Citizens at its core is an attempt to bridge the gap between “traditional” learning and new modes of interaction, and so finding ways to combine these two approaches is at the heart of the experience! Here are some suggestions we have. If you have your own way of using Emerging Citizens, please let us know!\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions on how to engage larger groups of students. \r\n\r\n- Have your students team up in pairs. \r\n- Alternately, have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the other student vote. \r\n- Form groups and for each round, have one student act as the “leader.”\r\n- Or, form groups and have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the group vote together. \r\n- Educators can also create an analog point bonus question system. Add opportunities for additional bonus points by asking questions in-between rounds to the students who are not playing. They then can award those earned points to their “champion” (who is an active player). \r\n\r\n## Can I create my own content to use in the game?\r\nThough we will be supporting this feature in the future, we currently don’t have the ability for a facilitator to create their own content. That said, we are looking for anyone who is interested in our platform and would like to partner with us to create your own category! If interested, Email Becky@elab.emerson.edu and we can get that ball rolling! \r\n\r\n## Can I censor or filter content that players make from appearing on the main screen? \r\nNo. We believe in open classroom discussion, which may be inspired by particular submissions for the various games within Emerging Citizens. Likewise, We advocate for players to use their real names so they can remain accountable. Educators may even choose to make this a requirement. \r\n\r\n## Is there a way for me to save any content made in the game? \r\nUnfortunately, this feature is unavailable at this time, but we will look into implementing it in the future! \r\n\r\n## How do I play a game with specific content?\r\nWhen you select a game to play, you will be given the option to select one or more content catagories for that particular game session.\r\n\r\n## How do I start a game?\r\n1. The main screen is the game screen that can be seen by all players. This can be a TV, projector, large computer monitor, or any other device as long as all players can see it!\r\n1. Select a game on your main screen via emergingcitizens.org to create a game lobby and room code.\r\n1. Once all your players have joined the game, select the “Launch Game” or “Start Game” option on the main screen.\r\n\r\n## How do players join a game?\r\n1. The player screen is private and each player has their own. Players can use any internet connected device such as a laptop, phone or tablet, as their player screen!\r\n1. Players join a game on their device via ecplay.org by entering their name and room code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contact Us\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in using your own lesson plans with Emerging Citizens or setting up a workshop for you and your group, please contact **becky@elab.emerson.edu.** \r\n\r\nFor business, research, or collaboration opportunities: **paul@elab.emerson.edu**\r\n\r\nFor any technical related problems or issues: **jordan@elab.emerson.edu**"},"description":"Bluff with Hashtags.

Learning goals are also reinforced through a digital Android game. The curriculum teaches children how to use a squat toilet and wash hands with soap, when it is important to wash hands with soap in order to prevent germ transfer, why handwashing and toilet use are important for individual and community health, and how to convince friends and family to practice healthy hygiene and sanitation.

Existing partnership models do little to assure that academic research goals meet community needs. This project works to amplify the voices of community-based organizations and ensure that they play an active role in deciding such key issues as the relevance, goals and ethics guiding research in their own communities.  The Community Approach to Research Partnerships (CARP) emerged out of the Boston Civic Media Consortium, a network of civic media researchers and organizational partners in Boston. A series of interviews, discussion groups, and facilitated workshops with members across the academic and community stakeholder spectrum will contribute to the creation of a document that organizations can use to structure their institutional collaborations.  In addition to building the capacity of local organizations and improving end-user designs, the outcomes of the project may serve as a national precedent for how community groups can enter academic partnerships from an equitable negotiating position.  The MOU Template To put mutually-beneficial partnerships into practice, download our paper Community Academic Research Partnerships in Digital Contexts: Opportunities, Limitations, and New Ways to Promote Mutual Benefit in the Resources tab below. The MOU is a suggested series of prompts for the researcher and subject parties to arrive at a set of mutual interests, shared decision-making practices, and an agreed-upon understanding of data ownership practices.

The OEO will use game and survey data to better understand immigrants’ experiences, identify gaps in Portland’s resources, and inform budgeting decisions for the City of Portland.","strategyTxt":"In the game, the player takes on the role of an immigrant or refugee who has just arrived in Portland and now must discover and navigate the city’s services in order to reach their goals. All of the locations and services within the game are real and offer a variety of opportunities to players - if they have the right skills and resources. Points are earned by gaining a mix of skills (English proficiency, job training, and community engagement) as well as two distinct ‘power-ups’ (learning public transportation and getting a job). Players begin with a limited amount of two key resources, time and money, which they must spend strategically in order to progress. The game is playable on desktop or mobile devices.","indexed":true,"archived":false,"bgImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/pic7qsyqynuds8zpc9nr","version":1598829311,"signature":"15133f14c7361f49fa09c800287ec93c90c50016","width":1200,"height":840,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1598829311/homepage-2.0/projects/pic7qsyqynuds8zpc9nr.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1598829311/homepage-2.0/projects/pic7qsyqynuds8zpc9nr.png"},"endYear":"2019","initiatives":[{"$oid":"5c096ca9d950c730b98c28ae"}],"partners":[{"$oid":"5f4c3349885c3c56ca643dd0"}],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/kccpyyoaelni3jd0yors","version":1598923283,"signature":"f9051fbf99ae0bdfe16b5c81c139a1dea25d9cea","width":1920,"height":1080,"format":"jpg","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1598923283/homepage-2.0/projects/kccpyyoaelni3jd0yors.jpg","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1598923283/homepage-2.0/projects/kccpyyoaelni3jd0yors.jpg"},"primaryImageDescription":"","projectLeads":["Eric Gordon"],"publications":[],"startYear":"2018","status":"Completed","teamMembers":[]}

Located in downtown Boston, Chinatown has presented a challenging context for planning: as an ethnically and socio-economically diverse area in the shadow of the rapidly gentrifying financial and theater districts, the neighborood has had to embrace gentrification while struggling to maintain its unique identity both as a Chinese community and as a welcoming  place for new immigrants. Over the course of the last several decades, the Chinatown community has engaged in countless community meetings meant to engage the residents of the neighborhood in the decision-making process. Every ten years, the process starts again, so that the community may assess past changes and plan for the future.
