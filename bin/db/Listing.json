The curriculum was facilitated in 10 intervention schools between 9 and 30 March 2017, and 10 additional schools, which did not receive the curriculum, were used as a comparison group. Schools were randomly assigned to groups. Lack of handwashing infrastructure was a criteria for inclusion in the study.

These courses reinforced important safety habits--such as maintaining motor bikes and driving safely--and trained drivers in how to be first-responders if they were involved in or witness to an accident. Riders who passed the course were awarded special jackets that they could wear on their routes, signifying they were trained and certified. The Boda-Boda game was originally designed by Emerson College undergraduates in a Games for Social Change course then further incubated through the Lab and finally on site in Uganda.

The study found that technologies used by non-profits often end up not reaching their intended impact. Instead they exacerbate the already limited capacity of the organization and force a different style of communication. We identified a distinction between functional and representational uses of tech: functional is what the tech is designed to do, and representational is how people talk about the tech. We found that the representational value had a much more lasting impact on the community and the organization than did the functional value.

The Lab worked closely for 10 months with a community development corporation (CDC) in a Boston neighborhood to test the impact of a series of digital and offline tools for participatory planning on the community. Simultaneously, the lab conducted an organizational ethnography of the CDC to help them better understand their capacity in the area of communications and technology.","indexed":true,"archived":false,"endYear":"2014","initiatives":[{"$oid":"5c096ca9d950c730b98c28ae"}],"partners":[],"primaryImageDescription":"","projectLeads":[],"publications":[],"startYear":"2013","status":"Completed","teamMembers":[],"bgImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05","version":1599183846,"signature":"3061cd29f7b1ea63fed84722c9b54484a05dcf1d","width":1452,"height":906,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/xtflwjsnfxfizqurvl05.png"},"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc","version":1599183846,"signature":"87b48e3f99f070b3b5ee32423399ace4bf76865a","width":1600,"height":1196,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599183846/homepage-2.0/projects/puf9uuybfqav0nx1busc.png"}}

conclusively shows that breastfeeding saves lives, prevents disease, and provides optimal infant nutrition. But due to gaps in postpartum care, policy, and technology, it is almost impossible for parents in the US to fulfill the basic public health goal of exclusive breastfeeding for six months. And when women \"fail\", they blame themselves instead of the broken systems around them.","customUrl":"","projectType":"Event","resultsTxt":"The event built off of the 2014 hackathon which resulted in 80+ articles in the press, an online documentary, a Facebook community, and two peer-reviewed research papers. In the year leading up to the 2018 Hackathon, the research team conducted applied qualitative and quantitative research with low-income women to understand the triumphs and challenges of feeding their babies. These digital stories and follow-up interviews resonated nationwide with women from diverse demographics and helped ensure that hackathon designs and ideas were inclusive. This initiative was developed with support by the MIT Center for Civic Media and made possible by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Medela, as well as corporate sponsors. The Breast Pump Hackathon has been featured in Slate, Vogue, The Atlantic, and The Boston Globe.","strategyTxt":"To address these issues, the Hackathon included a variety of events and spaces; it was a design sprint for designers, engineers, parents, and health care providers. The Make Family Leave Not Suck Policy Summit acted as a convening for national thought leaders on paid family leave policy. The Innovators Gallery was an exhibitor space with 25 top breastfeeding tech companies such as Medela and EvenFlo. There was also an art exhibition showcasing artwork related to breastfeeding and pumping. And perhaps most importantly, there was the Baby Village, a space for babies and parents to chill and get massages. There was also a “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon. Participants in the accelerator represent people who have not traditionally been involved in hackathons but who were already talented innovators and advocates for low-income families in their communities. The 2018 Hackathon also recognized that the future is intersectional. Working with equity expert Jennifer Roberts and the Office of Diversity and Student Support at the Media Lab, Historically Black Colleges and Universities helped support the participation of undergraduate students in the hackathon and policy summit.\r\nThere was also a  “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon.

Although designed with a South East Asia focus, the game can be applied to any setting.\r\n\r\n#### Number of players\r\n10 to 30 children or youth (preferably of the same age group) \r\n\r\n#### Time needed for gameplay/discussion \r\n80 to 120 minutes (depending on experience of facilitator, group size, and desired level of discussion during gameplay)."},"description":"is a curriculum consisting of games and playful activities that helps youth to understand climate change and take climate adaptation actions in their community.","enabled":true,"externalLinkUrl":"http://climatecentre.org/resources-games/act-to-adapt","featured":false,"files":[],"format":[{"$oid":"597ba029649f97105bca3b8f"}],"githubUrl":"","headerImage":{"public_id":"site/research/projects/izngzkmpk7c6eb8j7fwl","version":1454617480,"signature":"b2657ef98fab675ad9ecf724482d782d00adeae0","width":1200,"height":400,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1454617480/site/research/projects/izngzkmpk7c6eb8j7fwl.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1454617480/site/research/projects/izngzkmpk7c6eb8j7fwl.png"},"image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/loavwcc2b2oh2tsmlaj5","version":1603406066,"signature":"6596f1ef8c2831925254610750c9dda04e857d12","width":1501,"height":1501,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1603406066/homepage-2.0/listings/loavwcc2b2oh2tsmlaj5.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1603406066/homepage-2.0/listings/loavwcc2b2oh2tsmlaj5.png"},"investigatorPerson":"Eric Gordon","key":"y-adapt","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b9fe4649f97105bca3b87"},{"$oid":"597b9ff3649f97105bca3b89"},{"$oid":"597b9ffd649f97105bca3b8a"},{"$oid":"597ba004649f97105bca3b8b"}],"managerPerson":"Wade Kimbrough","name":"Y-Adapt","overview":{"md":"Y-Adapt is a curriculum consisting of games and playful activities that create real world action around climate change.

There are three learning guides total, with one for each game. \nLesson plans are tied to content categories. For example, there is one lesson plan for US Politics for Hashtag you’re it, another lesson plan for Wikigeeks, and another lesson plan for US Politics for Wait, Wait Don’t Meme Me! They all have related content, but different lesson plans. There also may be more than one lesson plan per game for the same category.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"when-will-lesson-plans-be-available-\">When will lesson plans be available?</h2>\n<p>Hang tight!

Where do I find the room code?</h2>\n<p>A room code is a unique string of letters that allows users to connect to a specific game with one another. The game code can be found in two places. First, the game code can be found on the educator’s main screen (game lobby) before gameplay begins. You can also look at the URL of the game lobby. The last four capitalized letters in the URL is the room code. </p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-play-this-with-players-in-different-classrooms-or-classroom-versus-classroom-\">Can I play this with players in different classrooms or classroom versus classroom?</h2>\n<p>Yes, By using streaming services like Twitch or screen sharing services like google hangout, you can play with people from all over the world as long as they have an internet connection. </p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-play-with-more-than-eight-players-\">Can I play with more than eight players?</h2>\n<p>No, but see the question below for ways to incorporate more players into the experience. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-play-this-in-the-classroom-if-only-eight-students-can-play-\">How can I play this in the classroom if only eight students can play?</h2>\n<p>We are working on additional features that will allow more students to participate in an active way. But even with only eight active players, there are many ways to incorporate entire classrooms into the experience in many different ways. Emerging Citizens at its core is an attempt to bridge the gap between “traditional” learning and new modes of interaction, and so finding ways to combine these two approaches is at the heart of the experience! Here are some suggestions we have. If you have your own way of using Emerging Citizens, please let us know!</p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions on how to engage larger groups of students. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have your students team up in pairs. </li>\n<li>Alternately, have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the other student vote. </li>\n<li>Form groups and for each round, have one student act as the “leader.”</li>\n<li>Or, form groups and have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the group vote together. </li>\n<li>Educators can also create an analog point bonus question system. Add opportunities for additional bonus points by asking questions in-between rounds to the students who are not playing. They then can award those earned points to their “champion” (who is an active player). </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-create-my-own-content-to-use-in-the-game-\">Can I create my own content to use in the game?</h2>\n<p>Though we will be supporting this feature in the future, we currently don’t have the ability for a facilitator to create their own content. That said, we are looking for anyone who is interested in our platform and would like to partner with us to create your own category! If interested, Email Becky@elab.emerson.edu and we can get that ball rolling! </p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-censor-or-filter-content-that-players-make-from-appearing-on-the-main-screen-\">Can I censor or filter content that players make from appearing on the main screen?</h2>\n<p>No. We believe in open classroom discussion, which may be inspired by particular submissions for the various games within Emerging Citizens. Likewise, We advocate for players to use their real names so they can remain accountable.

That’s why we created a platform that combines digital literacy learning, user generated content, and game-based structures that’s easy to set-up, fun to play, and educationally powerful.\r\n\r\nWe created Emerging Citizens in order to understand how game based playful experiences can fill this gap.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n## What is Emerging Citizens?\r\nEmerging Citizens is a suite of digital multiplayer party games that teach students how to critique and create civic media. Paul Mihailidis, Associate Professor, and Co-Director of the Engagement Lab @ Emerson College, conducted a multi-year research project exploring how youth use social media to engage in civic life. He found that youth engage in social networking and cultural sharing in dynamic ways, but have trouble recognizing how their digital applications provide productive connectivity, vibrant communication, and diverse information consumption in daily life. Therefore, we created a platform that combines digital literacy learning and user-generated content with game-based structures that are easy to set up, fun to play, and educationally powerful.You can read more about Emerging Citizens here. \r\n\r\n## What is Wikigeeks?\r\nWikiGeeks is a real-time race played within Wikipedia.org that gives players a topic, asks them to choose a starting page, and then race to be the first player to reach a revealed Wikipedia page using only hyperlinks. Learn more about Wikigeeks  here.\r\n\r\n## What is Hashtag You’re It? \r\nHashtag You’re It is a Twitter-based bluffing game where players read real tweets with hidden hashtags, submit their own hashtag to fool other players, and then attempt to guess the real hashtag themselves without getting tricked. Learn more about Hashtag You’re It here.\r\n\r\n## What is Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me? \r\nWait Wait Don’t Meme Me! is a meme-creation voting game that gives players a topic, asks them to make a meme about that topic, and then vote on which player’s meme best matches a revealed description. Learn more about Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me here.\r\n\r\n## What is a “content category”? \r\nWithin Emerging Citizens, there are different content categories. For example, some content categories are: US Politics, Migration and Science & Technology. Each category is tied to one or more lesson plans that are specific to a certain game in the Emerging Citizens Suite.\r\n\r\n## What is the difference between our learning guide and a lesson plan? \r\nA learning guide is a document that educators can use to familiarize themselves with one of the games included in the Emerging Citizens suite. There are three learning guides total, with one for each game. \r\nLesson plans are tied to content categories. For example, there is one lesson plan for US Politics for Hashtag you’re it, another lesson plan for Wikigeeks, and another lesson plan for US Politics for Wait, Wait Don’t Meme Me! They all have related content, but different lesson plans. There also may be more than one lesson plan per game for the same category.  \r\n\r\n## When will lesson plans be available? \r\nHang tight! Our learning plans will be available January 2017. \r\n\r\n## What is a lesson plan? \r\nA lesson plan is a document that uses one specific content category for learning material, but can be applied to one or more games within the Emerging Citizens suite. Educators can reference lesson plans to help guide classroom activities and discussions. \r\n\r\n## How do I use a lesson plan? \r\nEach lesson plan has a specified topic and game that complements the content of the lesson. After picking a lesson plan, choose the game included in the lesson and select the appropriate topic(s) before you launch the game. \r\n\r\n## Is there a way to use my own lesson plans? \r\nIf you are interested in using your own lesson plans with Emerging Citizens, please submit your ideas in this typeform. We think it’s very important for teachers to share their ideas with other educators, so we are working to create a library of user-created lessons. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What devices are supported?\r\nAs a web-based game, Emerging Citizens has been developed to play on a range of mobile devices and desktop computers.\r\n\t\tiOS: iOS7+ (iPhone 4/iPad 2 or later)\r\n\t\tAndroid: Ice Cream Sandwich+ (Generally devices made in 2011 or later)\r\n\t\tWindows/Mac (Browser): Internet Explorer 10+/Safari 5.1+/Chrome\r\n_We recommend playing Emerging Citizens with the most up-to-date version of IE/Safari/Chrome for the best experience._\r\n\r\n## What happens if a player gets disconnected? \r\n- If a player becomes disconnected from a game before it starts, they must join the lobby again.\r\n- If a player becomes disconnected from a game after it starts, they may refresh the page on their device to reconnect. They might need to wait for the next round before being able to participate again.\r\n- If a player closes the game page on their device, they are permanently disconnected from the session.\r\n- If enough players disconnect that only one remains in the session, the session will end automatically after 15 seconds.  \r\n\r\n## Why is my device not connecting? \r\n- Can your device connect to the internet/other sites? An active internet connection is required to play Emerging Citizens.\r\n- Is your internet connection particularly slow? Emerging Citizens requires real-time communication between multiple devices in order to play.\r\n- Are you behind a firewall, network filter, or using anti-virus software that blocks the use of web sockets? Emerging Citizens uses sockets to function, so ensure that they are open on your network or check with your IT administrator.\r\n- Is your device/operating system/browser supported? Check the list above to make sure you’re playing on a supported platform and that your software is up-to-date. \r\n- Are you playing in “Incognito” or other private-browsing modes? These browser modes can interfere with the connection between a device and the game. \r\n\r\n## What happens if I close out the window with the main screen? \r\nIf the main screen is refreshed or closed, all players will be disconnected from the session and the game will end.\r\n\r\n## I accidently closed my player screen browser window. Can I rejoin?\r\nUnfortunately, if the browser window is closed, the device becomes permanently disconnected from the session. \r\n\r\n## I put my phone to sleep. Can I rejoin? \r\nTry refreshing your browser window. You should see a message that says “resuming your session.” You might need to wait until the end of the current round before you rejoin the game.\r\n\r\n## Can I play using low-power mode?\r\nIf your phone is in low power mode, we cannot keep your device awake during the game. We encourage you to remind players to disable low power mode in their devices’ settings or plug in their devices before the game begins.\r\n\r\n## Why is my device telling me that the emerging citizens site, and other associated sites are unsafe?\r\nThis is just a security certificate problem. You can progress to the website by selecting Advanced options and clicking the link to proceed to the website. Please know that we value your privacy and we will at no time be saving your data or asking for your data.\r\n\r\n## How do players win? \r\nEach of Emerging Citizens’ games are point-based. The player with the most points wins! \r\n\r\nIn Wikigeeks, players win points based on how quickly they can navigate to the target article, and how many clicks it takes them to reach there. [Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/wikigeeks)\r\n\r\nIn Hashtag You’re It, points are acquired through tricking players into choosing their hashtag as well as guessing the correct hashtag for the tweet portrayed on the screen.[ Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/htyi)\r\n\r\nIn Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me, players win points by having their memes voted for by other players. [Read the full instructions here.](https://www.emergingcitizens.org/about/wwdmm)\r\n\r\n## What is a room code? Where do I find the room code?\r\nA room code is a unique string of letters that allows users to connect to a specific game with one another. The game code can be found in two places. First, the game code can be found on the educator’s main screen (game lobby) before gameplay begins. You can also look at the URL of the game lobby. The last four capitalized letters in the URL is the room code. \r\n\r\n## Can I play this with players in different classrooms or classroom versus classroom?\r\nYes, By using streaming services like Twitch or screen sharing services like google hangout, you can play with people from all over the world as long as they have an internet connection. \r\n\r\n## Can I play with more than eight players?\r\nNo, but see the question below for ways to incorporate more players into the experience. \r\n\r\n## How can I play this in the classroom if only eight students can play? \r\nWe are working on additional features that will allow more students to participate in an active way. But even with only eight active players, there are many ways to incorporate entire classrooms into the experience in many different ways. Emerging Citizens at its core is an attempt to bridge the gap between “traditional” learning and new modes of interaction, and so finding ways to combine these two approaches is at the heart of the experience! Here are some suggestions we have. If you have your own way of using Emerging Citizens, please let us know!\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions on how to engage larger groups of students. \r\n\r\n- Have your students team up in pairs. \r\n- Alternately, have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the other student vote. \r\n- Form groups and for each round, have one student act as the “leader.”\r\n- Or, form groups and have one student make the meme or hashtag and have the group vote together. \r\n- Educators can also create an analog point bonus question system. Add opportunities for additional bonus points by asking questions in-between rounds to the students who are not playing. They then can award those earned points to their “champion” (who is an active player). \r\n\r\n## Can I create my own content to use in the game?\r\nThough we will be supporting this feature in the future, we currently don’t have the ability for a facilitator to create their own content. That said, we are looking for anyone who is interested in our platform and would like to partner with us to create your own category! If interested, Email Becky@elab.emerson.edu and we can get that ball rolling! \r\n\r\n## Can I censor or filter content that players make from appearing on the main screen? \r\nNo. We believe in open classroom discussion, which may be inspired by particular submissions for the various games within Emerging Citizens. Likewise, We advocate for players to use their real names so they can remain accountable. Educators may even choose to make this a requirement. \r\n\r\n## Is there a way for me to save any content made in the game? \r\nUnfortunately, this feature is unavailable at this time, but we will look into implementing it in the future! \r\n\r\n## How do I play a game with specific content?\r\nWhen you select a game to play, you will be given the option to select one or more content catagories for that particular game session.\r\n\r\n## How do I start a game?\r\n1. The main screen is the game screen that can be seen by all players. This can be a TV, projector, large computer monitor, or any other device as long as all players can see it!\r\n1. Select a game on your main screen via emergingcitizens.org to create a game lobby and room code.\r\n1. Once all your players have joined the game, select the “Launch Game” or “Start Game” option on the main screen.\r\n\r\n## How do players join a game?\r\n1. The player screen is private and each player has their own. Players can use any internet connected device such as a laptop, phone or tablet, as their player screen!\r\n1. Players join a game on their device via ecplay.org by entering their name and room code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contact Us\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in using your own lesson plans with Emerging Citizens or setting up a workshop for you and your group, please contact **becky@elab.emerson.edu.** \r\n\r\nFor business, research, or collaboration opportunities: **paul@elab.emerson.edu**\r\n\r\nFor any technical related problems or issues: **jordan@elab.emerson.edu**"},"description":"Bluff with Hashtags.

In light of the recent humanitarian crisis in Syria and its impact on communities across the globe, this project will use the case of migration to explore how media frames issues, sets public agendas, and engages in cultural meaning-making in the digital public sphere.  Public bodies and citizens affected by the migration crisis are using connective platforms, social networks and digital technologies to consume, produce, express and share information in ever more open, diverse, and collaborative ways. Media literacy thus becomes central to how citizens demand diverse and balanced media coverage of issues, create and share their own narratives about issues of importance to them, and interact with policy makers and government officials about how such issues impact contemporary society.  This project, in partnership with the IFA (Institut Für Auslandsbeziehungen), will examine how digital media is effectively used as a tool to share and repurpose information, cultivate cultural meaning-making and inspire social action.  The outcome will be a report on media literacy, public policy and migration, and a robust online resource that synthesizes a set of media literacy recommendations for those involved with developing constructive online messaging campaigns for and by communities impacted by migration. The findings of the research will be shared at a public workshop designed in coordination with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change.  Banner Image: Mare Nostrum, 2014.

These verses dealt with with the adventures of inhabitants of various Irish towns, and the chorus extended the invitation: “Will you come up to Limerick?” Limericks often have bawdy, pornographic and vulgar subject matter which makes them perfect for contemporary American politics.\nWant to write your own?

The name’s genealogy is generally considered to be a reference to the city or county of Limerick, Ireland. The early nineteenth century brief songs were  sung at convivial gatherings in the city of Limerick in Ireland. These verses dealt with with the adventures of inhabitants of various Irish towns, and the chorus extended the invitation: “Will you come up to Limerick?” Limericks often have bawdy, pornographic and vulgar subject matter which makes them perfect for contemporary American politics.\r\nWant to write your own?

We call these \"quantitative political poetry parties\" or QPPPs.  At the QPPPs, we write limericks, talk politics, and share information. By remixing candidates' top words and phrases on the campaign trail we produce limericks about politics, campaigning and the political process that were never spoken outright (but maybe should have been). Mostly liberals have staged them and the left is currently winning the limerick war.  The best limericks have been realized as data visualizations in an exhibition space at the Harvard Center for American Political Studies for their Political Analytics Conference. The color corresponds to the candidate who most frequently spoke that word or phrase. The size of the term is the relative frequency of that word related to other words spoken on the campaign trail.  Anyone can stage a QPPP using our Limerick Party Pack, which you can download in the resources section at the bottom of this page. QPPP's have been staged in Boston, Hartford, and Ronald Reagan's former apartment in Des Moines, IO.

Players assume the role of a fictional character in the Chinatown neighborhood and they go on one of three missions: find a job, find a place to live, or find a place to socialize. In the first part of the game, players assume the role of their characters. In the second part of the game, they can act as themselves, and they are asked to prioritize values for the planning process. The players' comments and decisions are shared with decision-makers in the community to help with the development of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nSince 1990, Chinatown, a 46-acre neighborhood in Boston has been engaged in several master-planning processes to determine the future growth pattern of the neighborhood. Located in downtown Boston, Chinatown has presented a challenging context for planning: as an ethnically and socio-economically diverse area in the shadow of the rapidly gentrifying financial and theater districts, the neighborood has had to embrace gentrification while struggling to maintain its unique identity both as a Chinese community and as a welcoming  place for new immigrants. Over the course of the last several decades, the Chinatown community has engaged in countless community meetings meant to engage the residents of the neighborhood in the decision-making process. Every ten years, the process starts again, so that the community may assess past changes and plan for the future. Collection of community input for the most recently completed 2010 master plan was facilitated by five public meetings between July 2009 and June 2010.\r\n\r\nThe resulting plan was meant to guide conversation for the coming decade.

The conversation and digital interactions taking place at communal play tables was the focal point of each player's experience. In addition to the physical proximity of players sharing a table, each table represented a multi-player game where players could interact in a shared virtual environment. The meeting was facilitated in such a way that the small group interactions at the tables and in the virtual Chinatown were periodically shared with the front of the room.

Players take on the role of interplanetary media-makers and compete both as individuals and groups to win the top prize in an intergalactic media festival. Over the course of the game, players hailing from four different planets are challenged to collaborate to create the best creative work, but must pit their individual goals against that of the group. These goals are designed to highlight real-world biases, so players are motivated to work with people similar to them (from the same planet, wearing the same shoes, etc.) to achieve a personal victory.

The report presents a method of process evaluation that allows practitioners to measure their progress along two central axes: social infrastructure and objective. Civic media practice is always striving towards strong social infrastructure and longevity. As a means of measuring progress along these axes, we identify four activities that can be tracked. They include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Network Building</li>\n<li>Holding Space for Discussion</li>\n<li>Distributing Ownership    </li>\n<li>Persistent Input</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We present reflective questions that can be asked throughout a civic media project to track progress in these areas. Finally, we provide recommendations for practitioners and funders as they create and support civic media practice. The institution of civic media is nascent. This report is meant to solidify common principles and provide direction for those invested in transforming civic life through media practice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/civic_media_practice.pdf\">Download the full report</a>. </p>\n"},"person":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"},{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"principalInvestigator":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"},{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"projectImageCaptions":[],"projectImages":[],"sideImage":{"public_id":"site/research/projects/zmpyo3dj7zmng3cmwpfv","version":1518224242,"signature":"37b9433245ae535d00446ce41435ae98e96bf81b","width":1500,"height":1500,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1518224242/site/research/projects/zmpyo3dj7zmng3cmwpfv.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1518224242/site/research/projects/zmpyo3dj7zmng3cmwpfv.png"},"sortOrder":17,"startDate":{"$date":"2017-10-01T16:06:12Z"},"subdirectory":{"$oid":"56a112bdb94236513546c0d7"},"tabHeadings":[],"tabText":[],"videos":[],"challengeTxt":"","customUrl":"","projectType":"Curriculum","resultsTxt":"","strategyTxt":""}
