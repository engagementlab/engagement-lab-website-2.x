The most common process by which these, and many other, smart city technologies have found their ways into cities is through bilateral corporate-government deliberation. In contrast to these technology-centric visions that lack public reflection and democratic deliberation, the Lab’s Smart City Initiative places people and public value at the center of smart city efforts.","publications":[],"featuredProjectBlurb":""}

Yet, in the United States, the vast disparities in access to healthy food, medical care, affordable housing, good schools, and well-paying jobs have huge impacts on health. This divide persists beyond access, often excluding those most in need from the process by which health issues are identified and prioritized. The Lab’s Health Advocacy initiative builds capacities of communities around the world to articulate and advocate for their own well being. From improved hygiene for children in India, to humane maternal health policies in the US, and better preparation for people reentering society from prison, we work with organizations to bring people into the health design process in order to assure that they feel ownership of the outcomes they seek.","featuredProjectBlurb":""}

The majority of Americans do not trust the information they get from news sources and they generally believe the media is doing a poor job separating fact and opinion. News organizations have long been in the business of reporting on people. As trust in journalism continues to decline, there is real need for organizations to open up to their audiences and build capacity to report with people. Our Trust in the News initiative is focused on building capacity of news organizations, big and small, to better engage audiences in different and more relevant stories. This means creating more engaging content, but it also means creating relationships between publics and news organizations that are built on trust and negotiation. ","featuredProjectBlurb":""}
