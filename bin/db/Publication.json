The authors study the implementation of a game called Participatory Chinatown---a 3D, multiplayer game designed to be played in the shared physical space of a master planning meeting in Boston's Chinatown neighborhood. This research examines how role-play can affect the way people understand local issues and engage with their community. It also points to the challenges of extending player empathy from the magic circle of gameplay to the larger context of a community meeting. It suggests that emotional engagement with character and or space does not easily translate into a rational decision-making process.

As digital interventions flood the civic space, investigating the mediating interfaces that provide opportunities for deeper engagement becomes necessary. This article engages in design-based research that assesses the affordances and effects of one such platform: an interactive online game for local engagement called Community PlanIt (CPI). Drawing on an analysis of game mechanics, in-game actions, and interviews and focus groups with players, the authors ask if and how CPI can move citizen participation beyond isolated transactions. They draw two conclusions: CPI creates and strengthens trust among individuals and local community groups that is linked to confidence in the process of engaging, and it encourages interactive practices of engagement that the authors define as civic learning.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2015-12-03T18:27:45.043Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"5654aa55612ff206d0e7468a"},"date":{"$date":"2014-01-01T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"https://elab.works/playful","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"566089a196ac8cc659a92e35","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b8fd0ad0a3d3edf34f079"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"}],"sortOrder":8,"subCategory":{"$oid":"566075415022123b494ee5b3"},"title":" Playful Civic Learning: Enabling Lateral Trust and Reflection in Game-based Public Participation","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-29T18:18:57.044Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2a9ecc3072d2d5a0d1333"},"url":"http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2195","context":"International Journal of Communication","indexed":true,"purchaseUrls":""}

","blurb":"In this chapter, Mihailidis draws connections between young people, engagement in digital culture, and media literacy education. Media literacy, as both an educational and civic movement, promotes building individual agency—the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and produce effective personal and public communication—and social agency to actively participate in civil society on local, national and global levels. Through this lens, the author argues for media literacy as a new paradigm for active engagement in daily civic life. This will provide a framework that readers can reference as they explore in subsequent chapters the global case studies that show increased civic involvement through social media platforms and mobile technologies.

The paper concludes by asking three questions about post-secondary media literacy education: Should media literacy develop definitional parameters for the university? What differentiates media literacy from other media-related disciplines? What should media literacy look like in the university? and offers suggestions for future inquiry into post-secondary media literacy education that can enable dialog around media literacy frameworks for higher education.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T16:42:05.857Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2008-11-01T04:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elab.works/language","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"are-we-speaking-the-same-language-assessing-the-state-of-media-literacy-in-us-higher-education","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"sortOrder":36,"title":"Are We Speaking the Same Language?

In almost every case, readers can substitute the words “public library” for “school library” or “school media center” and the logical argument or the actionable policy recommendation would be exactly the same.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T17:02:22.223Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2014-01-14T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/from-information-reserve-to-media-literacy-learning-commons-revisiting-the-21st-century-library-as-the-home-for-media-literacy-education.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"from-information-reserve-to-media-literacy-learning-commons-revisiting-the-21st-century-library-as-the-home-for-media-literacy-education","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"sortOrder":39,"title":"From Information Reserve to Media Literacy Learning Commons: Revisiting the 21st Century Library as the Home for Media Literacy Education","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T17:02:24.975Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/from-information-reserve-to-media-literacy-learning-commons-revisiting-the-21st-century-library-as-the-home-for-media-literacy-education.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Public Library Quarterly","indexed":true,"purchaseUrls":""}

In recent years, there have been a proliferation of hackathons for social impact. Skeptics point out numerous shortcomings with hackathons, including poor problem-selection, diversity and inclusion issues around who participates, the exploitation of unpaid labor, limited impact, and the dangers of positing purely technological solutions to sociotechnical issues. In this paper the authors propose that incorporating a feminist design perspective can help mitigate some of these critiques. The authors articulate one vision for what a feminist hackathon looks like by leveraging their distinct backgrounds in Critical Making, Human-Centered Design and Interventionist Art Practice in tandem with Feminist Human Computer Interaction.

The scholarly literature on citizen journalism, however, has tended to concentrate on its significance for journalism theory and practice while comparatively neglecting underlying questions about the theories of citizenship utilized within citizen journalism. This article examines the range of theories of citizenship at work in citizen journalism, highlighting problems in trying to locate citizen journalism practices and practitioners within definitional debates around citizenship. It explores how some theories construct citizen journalism as a tool for citizenship whilst others construct it as constituting a form of citizenship in its own right. The article identifies a range of problems within these theories in terms of their capacity to understand the relationship between citizen journalism and citizenship. It argues that fully understanding and situating citizen journalism requires moving beyond the journalism-centered focus which dominates the literature towards a consideration of citizen journalism that incorporates theories and practices of citizenship alongside those of journalism.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T17:41:13.94Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2011-12-01T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elab.works/journalism","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"theorizing-journalism-education-citizenship-and-new-media-technologies-in-a-global-media-age","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"sortOrder":45,"title":"Theorizing Journalism Education, Citizenship, and New Media Technologies in a Global Media Age","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T17:41:17.432Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/theorizing-journalism-education-citizenship-and-new-media-technologies-in-a-global-media-age.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Taiwan Journal of Democracy, Volume 7","indexed":true,"purchaseUrls":""}

","blurb":"The increasing global ubiquity of mobile phones has called into question their efficacy as dynamic tools for engagement and participation in daily life. While there is little argument in their growth as primary communication tools, scholars have actively debated their role as conduits for dynamic and diverse, information flow. This study explores how an international cohort of university students uses mobile phones for daily communication and information needs. In spring 2012, 793 students from 8 universities on 3 continents participated in a 24-hour mobile tracking exercise and reflection to answer the questions: How are college students using mobile phones for daily communication\r\nand information needs? and, how do college students perceive of the role of mobile\r\nphones for communication and information needs in their daily lives? The findings point to a population tethered to their mobile devices primarily through social networking apps, to the extent that they find it increasingly difficult to distinguish relationships that exist in their pockets from those that exist in their physical surroundings.

Some reports seek to counteract deterioration or disorder in urban neighborhoods (e.g., potholes), suggesting that they might be motivated by territoriality. The authors examined this question through a survey of CRM users in Boston, MA, which was combined with their patterns of reporting, as derived from the CRM database (N = 660). The survey included measures of three territorial motives and social and personal relationships with the neighborhood. They tested a three-layer model in which neighborhood relationships predict territorial motives, and both predict reporting patterns. The findings suggest that the greatest motive for such reports is to benefit the community. Other results regarding the role of social cohesion and local social networks are also discussed. Overall, the study provides a substantive interpretation for CRM reports that was previously absent.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2016-03-23T10:30:26.215Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b0c17419394b6191baa2"},"date":{"$date":"2014-08-23T04:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-expressions-of-territoriality.pdf","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-counteracting-disorder","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b94fc93d1855392b87de5"}],"sortOrder":23,"title":"Caring About the Community, Counteracting Disorder: 311 Reports of Public Issues as Counteracting Disorder","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-05-15T20:25:43.069Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b0c27419394b6191baa6"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/caring-about-the-community-counteracting-disorder-311-reports-of-public-issues-as-expressions-of-territoriality.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Journal of Environmental Psychology ","indexed":true}

Online curation—an increasingly common way to refer to the act of organizing various content into cohesive online stories—has taken numerous forms in recent years. Media organizations are increasingly integrating such tools into their web presence. Curation is also being explored through remix—the sharing, repurposing, or re-appropriating of content online—as a function of creative commons and copyright, and in terms of cultural production and social structure. This chapter will build a framework for curation as it builds on existing models for digital and media education and remix culture. It will develop curation as a foundational media education competence to teach students about responsibility, purpose, and participation in social media spaces.","category":"Articles and Chapters","createdAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T18:53:28.296Z"},"createdBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"date":{"$date":"2014-01-01T05:00:00Z"},"description":{"html":"","md":""},"downloadUrls":"http://elab.works/scaffcur","enabled":true,"form":{"$oid":"597b94e293d1855392b87de3"},"isArticle":true,"key":"scaffolding-curation-developing-digital-competencies-in-media-literacy-education","keyword":[{"$oid":"597b941f93d1855392b87dd2"}],"person":[{"$oid":"597b8fb6ad0a3d3edf34f078"}],"sortOrder":48,"title":"Scaffolding Curation: Developing Digital Competencies in Media Literacy Education","updatedAt":{"$date":"2017-03-16T18:55:51.337Z"},"updatedBy":{"$oid":"56a2b189744a44c66297a172"},"url":"http://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/scaffolding-curation-developing-digital-competencies-in-media-literacy-education.pdf","urls":[],"context":"Media and Education in the Digital Age: Concepts, Assessments, Subversions","indexed":true,"purchaseUrls":""}
