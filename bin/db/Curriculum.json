{"_id":{"$oid":"5f219b91183ceeb3a65e3374"},"enabled":true,"name":"MD 610: Media Design Colloquium","description":"This class is based on the premise that Media Design students are designers and artists, and working to develop portfolios to position their work as such. This colloquium facilitates individual Media Design projects, offering a means for students to present and receive feedback on their work and critique the work of their peers. Work may be related or unrelated to thesis work. The course requires a project to be developed with tangible outcomes. Students develop work plans with research/production goals for their projects and detailed reading lists to support their work. At three points during the semester, students present work in various formats and engage in critique with peers. Students focus on critique as an emphasis for the workshop. To complement the presentations and student projects, the course invites guest speakers engaged in this work and covers seminars on topics related to media design and student projects (i.e., critique, funding, project development and management, business creation). Students keep directed study journal entries to document their inquiries and research/production processes.","__v":0}

The studio provides opportunity for students to make media in expressive or design modalities and to develop skills in working with partners. The studio provides a guided space in which to critically evaluate case studies in media design and develop production, project management, and evaluation skills. Students hone collaborative development and production skills that correspond with their project.","__v":0}

The course uses action research as our frame of inquiry and specifically looks at participatory research methodologies and qualitative methods, including focus groups, ethnography, observation, narrative inquiry, systems analysis, cultural artifacts, in-depth interviews, and more. Students learn how to design a qualitative research study (including process and outcomes evaluations), how to write funding proposals, and how to build participatory research processes into an intervention. Students investigate participatory media research case studies and examine how to best understand their value and impact. Students complete a series of assignments and write a final paper on qualitative research, including understanding how to pick the appropriate methods for the thesis evaluation. ","__v":0}

The studio provides an opportunity for students to develop visual, media and aesthetic literacy. The studio will provide a guided space in which to develop production, project management, and evaluation skills.  Media Design Studio I introduces design skills to support students in the creation of media projects. This course focuses on understanding the aesthetic and formal properties of different mediums and developing the visual and technological skills to work with those mediums. Media Design I emphasizes critique of peer work as well as critical thinking about how various media are being harnessed effectively by social justice initiatives, artistic interventions, and civic-minded organizations. Throughout this course, students are challenged to make intentional decisions and push creative boundaries while engaging in a process of media exploration, discovery, and application.","__v":0}
