The Make Family Leave Not Suck Policy Summit acted as a convening for national thought leaders on paid family leave policy. The Innovators Gallery was exhibitor space with 25 top breastfeeding tech companies such as Medela and EvenFlo. There was also an art exhibition showcasing artwork related to breastfeeding and pumping. </p>\n<p>And perhaps most importantly, there was the Baby Village, a space for babies and parents to chill and get massages. There was also a “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon. Participants in the accelerator represent people who have not traditionally been involved in hackathons but who were already talented innovators and advocates for low-income families in their communities. The 2018 Hackathon also recognized that the future is intersectional. Working with equity expert Jennifer Roberts and the Office of Diversity and Student Support at the Media Lab, historically black colleges and universities helped support the participation of undergraduate students in the hackathon and policy summit.</p>\n<p>There was also a “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon.
