Almost half (44%) of Americans today know someone who has been shot by a gun and nearly every American will know someone who has been shot during their lifetime. How do we understand the impact of gun violence on individuals, families and communities?  Who are the victims, who are the perpetrators, and what are their stories?  Are these narratives told with dignity, with the urgency due a public health crisis or have we as a society normalized them as part of our experience?</p>\n<p>In a new three-year partnership, Emerson Collegeâ€™s Engagement Lab, the Louis D. Brown Peace Institute and the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Massachusetts General Hospital are launching a Boston-based collaboration  to explore narrative interventions aiming to interrupt the crisis of gun violence through media, arts and communication.</p>\n<p>Join us on Thursday December 2nd at 2pm for the launch of Transforming Narratives of Gun Violence. Meet our community, faculty, and institutional partners, hear from advocates in the field, and learn how this collaborative initiative is modeling a new approach to public problem solving in Boston. Please see registration link below for a list of speakers.</p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"showButton":true,"buttonTxt":"Register here for this event ","images":[{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/events/vouzu1pfcn00swc1cqtj","__typename":"Image"}],"videoId":"","videoThumbnail":{"public_id":"","__typename":"Image"},"__typename":"Event"},"prev":[{"name":"Engagement Lab Speaker Series: Dr. Neenah Estrella-Luna","key":"engagement-lab-speaker-series-dr-neenah-estrella-luna","__typename":"Event"}],"next":{"name":"Engagement Lab Virtual Speaker Series: Gabe Mugar","key":"engagement-lab-virtual-speaker-series-gabe-mugar","__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
