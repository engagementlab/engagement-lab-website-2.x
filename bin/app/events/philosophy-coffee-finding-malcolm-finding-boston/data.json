In doing so, people learn to think in ways that are simultaneously both disciplined and imaginative.</p>\n<p>Philosophy coffees are informal discussions, hosted by the Engagement Lab, to discuss today’s most urgent questions. All members of the Emerson community are welcome. Complimentary coffee and snacks will be served!</p>\n<p>Finding Malcolm, Finding Boston:</p>\n<p>Join us for a conversation between Assistant Professor Lizzy Cooper Davis and theater artist Will Power about “Detroit Red,” Power&#39;s upcoming ArtsEmerson production about Malcom X’s time in Boston.
