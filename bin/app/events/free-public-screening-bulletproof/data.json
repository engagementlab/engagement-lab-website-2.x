The film observes the longstanding rituals that take place in and around American schools: homecoming parades, basketball practice, morning announcements, and math class. Unfolding alongside these scenes are a collection of newer traditions: lockdown drills, teacher firearms training, metal detector screenings, and school safety trade shows. Bulletproof asks what these rituals reflect back at us, looking beyond immediate causes and responses to mass shootings in a cinematic meditation on the array of forces that shape the culture of violence in the United States.</p>\n<p>Screening will be followed by a discussion with director Todd Chandler and Dr. Chana A. Sacks, MD, MPH of the MGH Center for Gun Violence Prevention.</p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"showButton":true,"buttonTxt":"Get Tickets Here","images":[{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/events/yc9ugybismdukqqc1cks","__typename":"Image"}],"videoId":"","videoThumbnail":{"public_id":"","__typename":"Image"},"__typename":"Event"},"prev":[{"name":"“Transformative Media Pedagogies” Book Launch Event","key":"transformative-media-pedagogies-book-launch-event","__typename":"Event"}],"next":{"name":"Engagement Lab Virtual Speaker Series: Gabe Mugar","key":"engagement-lab-virtual-speaker-series-gabe-mugar","__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
