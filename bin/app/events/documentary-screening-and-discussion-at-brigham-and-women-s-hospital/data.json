Brown Peace Institute to transform narratives of gun violence. Through a collaborative design approach, this initiative centers those most impacted by the effects of gun violence in the exploration and creation of narrative interventions to restore urgency, dignity, and humanity to the pervasive issue of gun violence. While students gain a deeper understanding from those directly impacted by the issue, community participants have the opportunity to gain new skills, have their stories heard, and ultimately co-create media that is personally meaningful and useful to their goals.</p>\n</p><p>\n\n<h3 id=\"about-the-films\"><strong>About the Films</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Quiet Rooms</em> is a 20-minute documentary about the impacts and root causes of gun violence and was co-created by Emerson students and community members. With bracingly honest interviews with community members impacted by gun violence, interwoven with quotes from The New England Journal of Medicine&#39;s piece, The Quiet Room, this visually stunning and emotionally charged work reflects the trust in process that was made possible through truly collaborative work.</p>\n</p><p>\n\n<p><em>Before the Bullets</em> was created alongside the Quiet Rooms documentary and features medical professionals from Mass General Hospital and advocates from Brigham’s Violence Recovery Program detailing their experiences and hopes for the future of gun violence prevention. They discuss what else needs to be done besides just patching up the bullet holes.</p>\n</p>","__typename":"Markdown"},"showButton":true,"buttonTxt":"RSVP today","images":[{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/events/vxfawuevj6nm8upndd8y","__typename":"Image"}],"videoId":"","videoThumbnail":{"public_id":"","__typename":"Image"},"__typename":"Event"},"prev":[{"name":"2023 Social Justice + Media Symposium","key":"2023-social-justice-media-symposium","__typename":"Event"}],"next":{"name":"Peace in Process: Spring 2023","key":"peace-in-process-spring-2023","__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
