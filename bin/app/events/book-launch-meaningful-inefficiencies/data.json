As a result, these organizations are quick to adopt new technologies to enhance what they do. However, efficiency, in the sense of charting a path to a goal with the least amount of friction, is not always built on a foundation of trust. Meaningful Inefficiencies is about the practices that challenge the normative applications of &quot;smart technologies&quot; in order to build or repair trust with publics.Based on over sixty interviews with change makers in public serving organizations throughout the United States, as well as detailed case studies, co-authors Eric Gordon and Gabriel Mugar provide a practical and deeply philosophical picture of civic life in transition. Meaningful Inefficiencies describes an emergent approach to creating civic life at a moment when smart and efficient are the dominant forces in social and organizational change.</p>\n<p>More information about the book can be found on the Oxford University Press site.</p>\n<p>Refreshments will be served.</p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"showButton":true,"buttonTxt":"RSVP","images":[],"videoId":null,"videoThumbnail":{"public_id":"","__typename":"Image"},"__typename":"Event"},"prev":[{"name":"Disinformation & Performance: A Workshop with Alex Juhasz and Ioana Jucan","key":"disinformation-and-performance-a-workshop-with-alex-juhasz-and-ioana-jucan","__typename":"Event"}],"next":{"name":"Social Justice and Media Symposium, 2020 Theme: Persistence","key":"social-justice-and-media-symposium-2020-theme-persistence","__typename":"Event"},"__typename":"EventResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
