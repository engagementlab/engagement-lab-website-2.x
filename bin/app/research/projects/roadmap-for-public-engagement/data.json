Cities participating in each cohort will outline the progress that they intend to make in advancing innovative practice over the duration of the cohort, and then will use a number of program elements to accelerate progress on their work, including: an innovation guidebook that highlights how leading practices can be concretely adapted, periodic convenings to learn from other cities and leading practitioners, coaching, technical assistance, and implementation resources to advance strategy and overcome barriers.","startYear":"2015","endYear":"2016","partners":[{"name":"Living Cities","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Citi Foundation","__typename":"Partner"}],"projectLeads":["Eric Gordon"],"teamMembers":[],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/ontjb5cw3fn6ayf7bd6s","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[{"title":"Accelerating Public Engagement","key":"accelerating-public-engagement","date":"Thu Dec 01 2016","author":"Gordon, E.
