These actions are local interventions that reduce the impacts of severe weather related events. These can be rapid onset events -such as heavy rain leading to flooding- or slow onset events - such as extreme heat leading to drought.  Y-Adapt is the product of a collaboration between the Engagement Lab, PLAN International, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the Philippines Red Cross, and PLAN Philippines.
