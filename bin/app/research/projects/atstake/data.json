Since then, it has been used in workshops and conferences all over the world. After increased demand for the game and a study that demonstrated its positive impact on group creativity, the Engagement Lab received a Knight Foundation prototype grant in 2015 to make a digital mobile version. The resulting digital game synthesizes and streamlines the tabletop experience to make it more immediately playable.","showFiles":null,"sortOrder":28,"strategyTxt":"With @Stake, players are provided a deeper understanding of community needs by considering different perspectives before making collective decisions. In the game, 3–5 players introduce their character’s perspectives, jump into think mode to invent creative solutions to the issue being discussed, and take turns proposing their ideas and arguing from their character’s point of view, complete with secret agendas. After three rounds, the player in the Decider role chooses the best idea and awards points. At the end of three rounds, the player with the most points wins the game.

The authors study the implementation of a game called Participatory Chinatown---a 3D, multiplayer game designed to be played in the shared physical space of a master planning meeting in Boston's Chinatown neighborhood. This research examines how role-play can affect the way people understand local issues and engage with their community. It also points to the challenges of extending player empathy from the magic circle of gameplay to the larger context of a community meeting. It suggests that emotional engagement with character and or space does not easily translate into a rational decision-making process. The authors make suggestions for future research that might address this challenge.","context":"5th International Conference on Communities & Technologies","downloadUrls":"https://elab.works/empathy","purchaseUrls":"","__typename":"Publication"},{"title":"Engagement Game Guidebook","key":"566087b096ac8cc659a92e33","date":"Wed Jan 27 2016","author":"Gordon, E.; et. al.
