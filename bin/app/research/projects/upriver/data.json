Water is added or subtracted from the cups with sponges, and players are asked to predict the final level. Players earn game currency by reporting the water level, weather, and other real-time information about their local area. They can earn more by placing bets about future conditions. The farther out their predictions, and more accurate their guesses, the larger the reward. To help make more accurate guesses, players may also purchase information about what players upstream from them are reporting, or buy access to a computer model. In the end, the player who is best able to leverage this information into accurate predictions will be deemed the winner.","startYear":"2013","endYear":"2014","partners":[{"name":"Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center","__typename":"Partner"}],"projectLeads":["Eric Gordon"],"teamMembers":[],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[{"title":"Loss and Damage in a Changing Climate - Games for Learning and Dialogue that Link HFA and UNFCCC","key":"loss-and-damage-in-a-changing-climate-games-for-learning-and-dialogue-that-link-hfa-and-unfccc","date":"Sat Nov 01 2014","author":"Suarez, P.; et al.","blurb":"The purpose of this manuscript is to examine the role of games for improving communication, spurring learning, and improving decision-making capacity about climate risk management amongst diverse stakeholders.
