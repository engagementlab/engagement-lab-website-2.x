These courses reinforced important safety habits--such as maintaining motor bikes and driving safely--and trained drivers in how to be first-responders if they were involved in or witness to an accident. Riders who passed the course were awarded special jackets that they could wear on their routes, signifying they were trained and certified. The Boda-Boda game was originally designed by Emerson College undergraduates in a Games for Social Change course then further incubated through the Lab and finally on site in Uganda. The game reinforces the basic tenets of the Red Cross training, focusing on the dangers of sharing credentials with riders who have not been certified and the extraordinary impact that this team of certified first-responders can have on people's daily lives if they trust each other and work together.","startYear":"2014","endYear":"2015","partners":[],"projectLeads":[],"teamMembers":[],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/aacuwq85fhzmiezxtsnn","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[],"__typename":"Project"},"prev":{"name":"Unlocking Health","key":"unlocking-health","__typename":"Project"},"next":{"name":"Work Flow","key":"work-flow","__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
