The Civic Data Ambassador program was a six-week online course that taught the basics of data literacy for a variety of use cases. Thirty librarians, from Boston and beyond, accessed material and completed activities online for approximately two hours a week. After the six week course, librarians understood what civic data consists of, what data is on the city's open data portal, and how to connect that data to real-world use cases and problems.","startYear":"2018","endYear":"2019","partners":[],"projectLeads":["Eric Gordon","Catherine D'Ignazio"],"teamMembers":[],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/slge1yldfhe94uqusude","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[],"__typename":"Project"},"prev":{"name":"Civic IDEA","key":"civic-idea","__typename":"Project"},"next":{"name":"Handwashing with Ananse","key":"handwashing-with-ananse","__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
