The game unfolds over two distinct phases of play, taking a total of 45 minutes, with the option of bein replayed In phase 1, players are tasked with exploring the region, talking to NPCs, gathering information, and putting together an RBF program proposal with 6 prioritized tactics. Players are then scored on the results of a simulated pilot year and given the opportunity to implement their own program and monitor it over the course of an additional 3 years, or to select another players's; proposed program to implement. During phase 2 of the game, players monitor the RBF plan, tackling questions and problems that arise during the year, while adapting the program to the shifting context in real time. By the end of the third year, players are assessed based on their ability to meet their health service target goals. Each new instance allows players to experiment with new choices and cope with different events that unfold over time in the fictional world.
