{"projects_the-deep-listening-project":{"data":{"getProject":{"project":{"challengeTxt":"The current process of climate adaptation is headed by intergovernmental organizations, international non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations and landmark agreements have been signed, with the commonality of involving a coordinated approach from all the stakeholders. Climate adaptation faces numerous obstacles including, inadequate support for in situ adaptation, fragmentation of policy regimes and responses, inadequate consultation with affected communities, and inequity in decision making among other social issues, that often prevent successful adaptation processes.","partnersTxt":[],"customUrl":"","externalLinkUrl":"https://www.climateadapt.mit.edu","files":[],"githubUrl":"","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/sfkfohdpgvbmv29aoxag","__typename":"Image"},"key":"the-deep-listening-project","name":"The Deep Listening Project","projectImages":[],"projectType":null,"resultsTxt":"This project will provide a rigorous examination and evaluation of how institutions currently collaborate with frontline communities in developing adaptation plans and create new technologies and procedures that can be adopted and adapted in contexts around the world.

They have also called for pluralistic approaches that do not assume homogeneity but that recognize the lived realities of multiple subjectivities, as well as those that consider the disruptions of the relation between space, place, and people. Procedural justice is necessary: not just providing consultations, but transforming institutional processes. We are looking to enhance 5 components of deep listening: Knowledge sharing, Holding space, Shared climate imaginaries, Sensemaking & Evaluation and monitoring.","startYear":"2021","endYear":null,"partners":[{"name":"MIT Center for Civic Media","__typename":"Partner"}],"projectLeads":["Eric Gordon, MIT Civic Design Initiative & Emerson College","James Paradis, MIT Civic Design Initiative","Yihyun Lim, IT Civic Design Initiative & University of Southern California"],"teamMembers":["Tom√°s Guarna, MIT","Gabriela Degetau, MIT","Mona Vijaykumar, MIT","William Uricchio, MIT","Sarah Wolozin, MIT","John (Craig) Freeman, MIT","Ceasar McDowell, MIT","Deb Roy, MIT","Patricia Saulis, MIT","Ulya Aviral, MIT","Henry Jenkins, USC Civic Paths Group","Sangita Shresthova, USC Civic Paths Group","Darren Ranco, University of Maine","Terry Irwin, Transition Design Institute, Carnegie Mellon University","Gideon Kossoff, Transition Design Institute, Carnegie Mellon University","Arnico Panday, Institute for Integrated Development Studies, Nepal","Prista Ratanapruck, Institute for Integrated Development Studies, Nepal"],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/xxbzmkn9ex9qcocil9ft","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[],"__typename":"Project"},"prev":{"name":"Boston Civic Connect","key":"boston-civic-connect","__typename":"Project"},"next":{"name":"Meetr","key":"meetr","__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
