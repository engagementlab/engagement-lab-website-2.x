{"projects_handwashing-with-ananse":{"data":{"getProject":{"project":{"challengeTxt":"Diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia are the two leading causes of death in children ages one month to five years worldwide, resulting in about six million deaths in children-under-five each year. In 2015 alone, approximately 10,000 children-under-five died from diarrhea and pneumonia in Ghana. Handwashing with soap and water (HWWS) is a low-cost, highly effective method for preventing illness and death from diarrheal and respiratory diseases. Handwashing with Ananse seeks to increase awareness and practice of HWWS by providing children an interactive and playful way to learn about handwashing, share what they learn with peers and family, and increase their practice of HWWS.","partnersTxt":[],"customUrl":"","externalLinkUrl":"https://elab.works/anansebook","files":[{"name":"Handwashing with Ananse Materials","file":{"url":"https://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/handwashingwithanansebookcompressed.pdf","__typename":"File"},"__typename":"Resource"},{"name":"Handwashing with Ananse Evaluation","file":{"url":"https://elabhome.blob.core.windows.net/resources/hwwa_evaluation.pdf","__typename":"File"},"__typename":"Resource"}],"githubUrl":"","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/k6amfxvn3d0ititqtj03","__typename":"Image"},"key":"handwashing-with-ananse","name":"Handwashing with Ananse","projectImages":[{"public_id":"site/research/projects/uoak3cn9wy8tyn7m8zoy","__typename":"Image"},{"public_id":"site/research/projects/t29hyf9f5bnngpynsjfv","__typename":"Image"},{"public_id":"site/research/projects/irhzkkyrqxugi1yttrxt","__typename":"Image"}],"projectType":null,"resultsTxt":"Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, two weeks post-intervention (post-test 1), and 15 weeks post-intervention (post-test 2).
