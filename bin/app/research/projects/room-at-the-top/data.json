","showFiles":null,"sortOrder":24,"strategyTxt":"Room at the Top is a playful intervention against bias and anti-collaboration, a massive multiplayer card game for groups from 12-200 people challenging assumptions about how we collaborate in creative environments. Players take on the role of interplanetary media-makers and compete both as individuals and groups to win the top prize in an intergalactic media festival. Over the course of the game, players hailing from four different planets are challenged to collaborate to create the best creative work, but must pit their individual goals against that of the group. These goals are designed to highlight real-world biases, so players are motivated to work with people similar to them (from the same planet, wearing the same shoes, etc.) to achieve a personal victory. Like in the real world, some players are more powerful than others because of the resources they (and their home planet) bring to the table.","startYear":"2016","endYear":"2017","partners":[],"projectLeads":["Miranda Banks"],"teamMembers":[],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/be3dhjc8xzz4ksepyrsf","__typename":"Image"},"primaryImageDescription":"","publications":[],"__typename":"Project"},"prev":{"name":"Boston Coastline Future Past","key":"boston-coastline-future-past","__typename":"Project"},"next":{"name":"Emerging Citizens ","key":"emerging-citizens","__typename":"Project"},"__typename":"ProjectResult"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
