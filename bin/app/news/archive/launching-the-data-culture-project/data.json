For some individuals, this means jumping into tools like Excel, <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com\">Tableau</a>, programming, or <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com\">R Studio</a>. But what does this mean for a group of people that work together? We often talk about data literacy as if it’s an individual capacity, but what about data literacy for a community? <strong>How does an organization learn how to work with data?</strong></p>\n<p>About a year ago we (<strong>Rahul Bhargava</strong> and <strong>Catherine D’Ignazio</strong>) found that more and more users of our <a href=\"https://databasic.io\">DataBasic.io</a> suite of tools and activities were asking this question — online and in workshops. In response, with support from the <a href=\"http://pacscenter.stanford.edu\">Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society</a>, we’ve worked together with 25 organizations to create the <a href=\"http://datacultureproject.org\">Data Culture Project</a>. We’re happy to launch it publicly today! Visit <a href=\"http://datacultureproject.org\"><strong>datacultureproject.org</strong></a> to learn more.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_JuH6aIPq7cmIPEt0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Data Culture Project is a hands-on learning program to kickstart a data culture within your organization</strong>. We provide facilitation videos to help you run creative introductions to get people across your organization talking to each other — from IT to marketing to programs to evaluation. These are not boring spreadsheet trainings! Try running our fun activities — one per month works as a brown bag lunch to focus people on a common learning goal. For example, “<a href=\"https://databasic.io/en/culture/sketch-a-story\">Sketch a Story</a>” brings people together around basic concepts of quantitative text analysis and visual storytelling. “<a href=\"https://databasic.io/en/culture/ask-questions\">Asking Good Questions</a>” introduces principles of exploratory data analysis in a fun environment. What’s more, you can use the sample data that we provide, or you can integrate your organization’s data as the topic of conversation and learning.</p>\n<h1 id=\"developing-together\">Developing Together</h1>\n<p>We built DataBasic.io to help individuals build their data literacy in more creative ways. We’ve baked in design principles that focused on learners (<a href=\"http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/1294\">read our paper</a>), argued to tool designers that their web-based tools are in fact informal learning spaces (<a href=\"http://www.openvisconf.com/2017/#dignazio_bhargava-video-item\">watch our talk</a>), documented how our activities are particularly well suited to data literacy learners (<a href=\"http://dataphys.org/workshops/dis17/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/06/Data_Phys_2017_Workshop-rev2.pdf\">read another paper</a>), and focused them on building a data mindset (<a href=\"http://public.imaginingamerica.org/blog/article/cultivating-a-data-mindset-in-the-arts-and-humanities/\">read our opinion piece</a>).</p>\n<p>These activities and tools were designed and iterated on with interested users (with support from the Knight Foundation). <strong>We develop all our tools based on the problem organizations bring to us</strong>. Our latest grant was a partnership with <a href=\"https://techboston.com\">Tech Networks of Boston</a>, who brought years of experience working with organizations to develop their capacity and skills in a variety of ways. We prototyped a first set of videos, for the WordCounter “Sketch a Story” activity with them, and tried it out in a local workshop with some of their partners and clients.</p>\n<h1 id=\"trying-out-a-model--the-data-culture-pilot\">Trying Out a Model — the Data Culture Pilot</h1>\n<p>Based on how that went, we recruited 25 organizations from around the world to help us build the Data Culture Project. Non-profits, newsrooms, libraries, community groups were included in this cohort, and we created a network to help us guide our prototyping. Over the last 6 months, each group ran 3 activities within their organizations as brown-bag lunches.</p>\n<p>It was wonderful to have collaborators that were willing to try out some half-baked things! After each workshop, they shared how it went on a group mailing list. Then each month we hosted an online chat to get feedback and share insights and common points from the feedback.</p>\n<p>Even in these prototype sessions, the participants shared some wonderful insights. Here are just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>“It did lead to a pretty significant rethink for the communications director for what is coming out in the spring.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“I hear back from participants regularly about how much they enjoyed the activities and wondering what comes next.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“As they were working through their data sets, they kept coming up with more questions it made them wonder about and more things to consider about those questions.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“They can relate everything back to their own situations/data/organizations.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We were heartened and excited to see that our design partners were able to see impacts already!</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-to-join-the-community\">How to Join the Community</h1>\n<p>We are launching the <a href=\"http://datacultureproject.org\">Data Culture Project</a> today. Here’s how to make the best use of the project and the community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Read about why <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rahulbot/building-a-data-culture-4f5c116448fc\">you don’t need a data scientist; you need a data culture</a> to understand why data literacy needs to be understood as a community capacity, in addition to an individual capacity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Run one or more of the activities listed on the <a href=\"http://datacultureproject.org\">Data Culture Project</a> home page. We found in the pilot that running one per month (and providing pizza) can work to bring people together.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Remix and modify the activity to work for you and tell us about it! At the bottom of <a href=\"https://databasic.io/en/culture/sketch-a-story\">each activity page</a>, you’ll see a “Learn With Others” comment box where you can tell others what worked for you (á la Internet food recipe sites).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Join <a href=\"https://groups.io/g/dataculture\">our mailing list</a> to connect with others working on creative approaches to building capacity in their organizations (and be the first to hear about new activities and projects).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_0S2nFxVfDYlSv2JX.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We are grateful to the <a href=\"http://pacscenter.stanford.edu\">Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society</a> for supporting the development of the Data Culture Project. The Data Culture Project is headed by Rahul Bhargava and Catherine D’Ignazio, undertaken as a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://civic.mit.edu\">MIT Center for Civic Media</a> and <a href=\"http://elab.emerson.edu\">the Engagement Lab@Emerson College</a>, and with the assistance of <strong>Becky Michelson</strong> (project manager) and <strong>Jon Elbaz</strong> (research assistant).</p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"__typename":"Blog"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
