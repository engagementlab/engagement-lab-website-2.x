She uses image, installation, and sound to tell stories and create a dialog around social issues, and has helped to facilitate art projects between college and K-12 students. Her thesis work focuses on the power of participatory art and self-representation through visual media.*</p>\n<p><strong>What was the path that brought you to CMAP?</strong>\nAfter taking community engagement courses at the University of the Arts, I became really interested in connecting arts institutions to underserved schools helping young people advocate for themselves through visual media.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_95aQgiBrJjuBGQU3N-a4SA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; I became really interested in connecting arts institutions to underserved schools helping young people advocate for themselves through visual media.</p>\n<p><strong>What is one change you would like to see in the world?</strong>\nSlower conversations. Social media does a great job of piquing interest in issues and spreading mass awareness, but we often move on from things so rapidly that effective conversations and action don’t take place. Also: I hope my hamster lives forever.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you want the civic media community to know about you?</strong>\nI’m a practicing artist and I’m excited to see how some of the themes in my personal work, specifically humor and online performance/identity, can cross over into the civic media space.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_QqtqA-D2pvF3_v0yfiEd2g.png\" alt=\"Anna’s undergraduate thesis project\"></p>\n<p>*<em>Are there any specific projects that you’ve done in the past that intersect with your studies now?\n*</em>My undergraduate thesis project was a satire of the game of Life that highlights the classist sentiments of the “American Dream.” Students and their families played it together at the exhibition, with the goal of facilitating conversations between millennials and their parents about some of the new challenges that they face when trying to achieve traditional “success” after graduating. I also made a series of pranks, performances, and installations to interrupt an ongoing anti-choice protest that took place outside of a Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you define engagement?
