We find new ways for communities to bring their voice forward, and new ways for institutions to respond. We work with partners to co-design solutions to the most pressing problems in democracy and governance, including participation gaps, gender or racial discrimination, lack of basic media literacies, youth exclusion, and gaps in public health practices. Our research and practice are influenced by the fields of media studies, communications, human centered design, and cultural studies. Our research ranges from basic research about play and learning to specific program evaluations.
