Lauren worked in journalism and local government throughout the suburbs of Chicagoland before coming to Boston to study Civic Media at Emerson.*</p>\n<p>*<em>What was the path that brought you to CMAP?\n*</em>I worked in journalism and local government before coming to CMAP to learn more about true, quality engagement methods and practices. I saw a lot of room for growth in civic engagement, and I felt drawn to learning about the innovative ways municipalities can help residents affect and lead government processes.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_iEfr6skKYsR5RdTif-DaZA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; I saw a lot of room for growth in civic engagement, I felt drawn to learning about the innovative ways municipalities can help residents affect and lead government processes.</p>\n<p>*<em>What does civic media mean to you?\n*</em>I see civic media as the variety of different communication and technology methods used to engage with public stakeholders.</p>\n<p>*<em>What is one change you would like to see in the world?\n*</em>I’d love to see a reversal of the widening partisanship gap, and I think civic media can help achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>*<em>What would you want the civic media community to know about you?\n*</em>That bureaucrats like me care about innovation and using creative ways to communicate with publics! I think government staff sometimes have a reputation for being rigid, but there is a lot of potential to incorporate new technology and media into the engagement process and I try to champion that as often as I can.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’ve done in the past that intersect with your studies now?</strong>\nI worked previously as a local government intern/analyst in several Illinois communities. These roles required a lot of engagement with different stakeholders groups as we worked to incorporate visioning from these groups into strategic planning, economic development and equity initiatives.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_J_8fSB5-gpPJXeSP6uZ93w.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>How do you define engagement? What does being engaged mean to you?</strong>\nBeing engaged is caring enough about something to be involved in the process for making it successful.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of your favorite pieces of media?</strong>\nThe New Yorker is my favorite media outlet, but I had to let my subscription lapse because it doesn’t fit into my financial and time budget right now. I’m looking forward to renewing when I graduate in August 2018!</p>\n<p><strong>What’s one fun fact most people don’t know about you?</strong>\nI won the “Best Dressed Student” award for my Civic Leadership Academy in 2017.</p>\n<p><em>Learn more about <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/cmap\">Civic Media, Art &amp; Practice</a>.</em></p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"__typename":"Blog"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
