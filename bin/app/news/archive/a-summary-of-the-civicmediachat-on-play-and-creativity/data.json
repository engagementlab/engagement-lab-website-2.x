The arc of the chat began by broadly examining playful interactions and then more specifically questioning our relationships to algorithms, institutional barriers, and societal values of artistic civic disruptions.</p>\n<p>&gt; A4: If we don&#39;t make civic learning inviting &amp; fun early on, how are we to get young people to do more than &#39;rock the vote&#39;? #civicmediachat\n&gt;\n&gt; <p> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anterobot/status/592786564553515010\">@anterobot</a></p>\n&gt; <em>Image 2: The importance of appealing to youth in a fun way for lifelong civic engagement, expressed by @anterobot</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Questions at a Glance</strong></p>\n<p>Q1: What role do play and creativity have in civic life?

Meanwhile, @pmihailidis and @wendyfhsu discussed if and how transparent algorithms could be brokered as civic data by municipal bodies. As the conversation shifted to barriers to playful civic projects, many expressed a frustration with funding opportunities, evaluation hurdles, and limiting impact assessments.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0*us0_yGbYVrHfo2Lq.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Image 5: Institutional hurdles to playful civic engagement found in the government by @wendyfhsu</em></p>\n<p>We are thrilled with the stimulating conversations, meme-ified jokes, and useful resource sharing that emerged. Thank you for your enthusiasm in promoting the chat and your patience with our first experiment with this type of convening! A special thank you to David Beasley, Communications Director of the Participatory Budgeting Project who provided extensive guidance for this event. Our next Twitter chat in early June will be, “Civic Media: Research Methods and Evaluation” and the following Twitter chat later this summer will focus on civic media curricula.
