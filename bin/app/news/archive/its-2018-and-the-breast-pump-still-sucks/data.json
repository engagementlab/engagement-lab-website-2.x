The Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon 2.0 is happening on <strong>April 27–29, 2018</strong> at the <strong>MIT Media Lab</strong>!</p>\n<p>Dear parents, investors, midwives, innovators, lactation consultants, community leaders and community listeners:</p>\n<p>A lot has happened in the space since our <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-2014-event/\">2014 hackathon</a>. We wrote <a href=\"http://www.kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CHI_Breast_Pump_Paper_2015.pdf\">two research papers</a> and talked with hundreds of experts, innovators and parents. New pumps and breastfeeding-supportive tech like <a href=\"https://nayahealth.com/\">Naya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.willowpump.com/\">Willow</a> and <a href=\"https://pacify.com/\">Pacify</a>and <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/199848383/u-boost-first-breast-pump-booster-for-improved-lac\">UBoost</a> have emerged on the scene. But they haven’t always gotten the funding they need to continue and affordability is still a problem. We STILL don’t have paid leave in the US, and mamas and parents struggle to meet their breastfeeding goals in an unsupportive environment. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/black-women-infant-mortality-rate-cdc-631178\">black and brown babies are four times more likely to die in their first year and the rate is going up</a>. Families in the US currently must choose between nursing their babies and paying their rent.</p>\n<p>&gt; &gt; We think it’s time for Round 2 and this time we want to catalyze a movement for equitable #BreastfeedingInnovation.</p>\n<p>We were astonished by the viral success of the <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/our-2014-event/\">2014 hackathon</a>, as well as its impacts. We are back with a <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/team/\">bigger team and an incredible Advisory Board</a> to catalyze brilliance in research, design, and policy for breastfeeding.
