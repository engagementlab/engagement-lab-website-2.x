With that we have asked the following questions to achieve a better understanding around issues of data literacy and storytelling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are overarching educational approaches and concrete class activities that can build data science capacity in non-technical communications fields such as journalism, documentary film, arts, and civic media? How does storytelling fit into that?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What are the ethics and privacy concerns of storytelling with data? How do we introduce and surface ethical dilemmas around data-sets in a safe learning environment? What is the ethical role of the storyteller in relation to the media product/audience (objectivity? transparency? other?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What do we mean by “civic impact”? What is the relationship between storytelling and social change? How do we measure impact?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How do we connect the historical contexts of storytelling and journalism?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outcomes of the Study Group</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of this study group is to build a network of educators and practitioners that can develop shared educational approaches on issues surrounding BUILDING CAPACITY and data literacy, the ETHICS of data and the CIVIC IMPACT of data-driven storytelling and how to measure it. In addition, sharing best practices, examples, and curricula will aid those in the study group and outside practitioners.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should apply to participate?</strong></p>\n<p>-People in the Boston area (no Skype-ing in, sorry)\n-Current and future educators in data journalism, civic media, civic engagement, digital storytelling, communications, data science and data visualization\n-Industry professionals interested in the pedagogy of their work — Journalists, Artists, Information Designers, Activists, Visualization, Statisticians, Data Scientists, Filmmakers\n-Researchers from Science Technology Studies, Social Computing, Human-Computer -Interaction, Art &amp; Design History, and other fields that study the impact of civics, data storytelling, and visualizations</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/getinvolved/studygroups/datastorytelling_call%20\">For more details and to apply to the program, click here.</a></p>\n<p>Feel free to share this opportunity with any others who might be interested in participating!</p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"__typename":"Blog"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
