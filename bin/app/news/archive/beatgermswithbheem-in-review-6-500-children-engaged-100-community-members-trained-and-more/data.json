Today, we’re excited to report some of the amazing results from our recent #BeatGermsWithBheem campaign.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_shZQYum2VKSUie4pDndJ1A.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The latest effort in our ongoing <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/hygiene\"><em>Hygiene with Chhota Bheem</em></a> hygiene and sanitation education project, <a href=\"https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/announcing-beatgermswithbheem-a-week-of-online-and-offline-hygiene-education-and-advocacy-69e486f6fc71\">#BeatGermsWithBheem</a> combined community hygiene training sessions, activities for students, stories from the field on social media, and more for a whirlwind week of advocacy.</p>\n<p>From new schools, NGOs, and community leaders in Tamil Nadu and beyond, to our followers across social media, we invited everyone to join the Bheem Team and help us celebrate the power that children have to advocate for sanitation and hygiene best practices in their communities!</p>\n<p>We were thrilled by the results. Throughout seven districts in Tamil Nadu, our curriculum reached more than 6,500 students across more than 35+ schools and 5 NGOs over the course of the week-long campaign.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we trained more than 100 trainers, who will now be able to hold additional workshops with children and train other community members to teach the program in their communities.</p>\n<p>We made a splash across our media channels as well! Our week of social media content, from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngageLab/status/1143601802895667201\">photos and videos of the week’s training sessions</a> to case studies from the field to <a href=\"https://medium.com/engagement-lab-emerson-college/building-a-sustainable-community-driven-future-for-hygiene-with-chhota-bheem-beatgermswithbheem-ae1b187e12f3\">in-depth blog articles about the program’s development</a> garnered well over 7,000 impressions throughout the week.</p>\n<p>And radio advertisements broadcast across Tamil Nadu reached more than 30,000 listeners, as well.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_xbxgIo5Wo4wDmtJZl02DLw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The stories we’ve heard from volunteers, community members, and children impacted by the program have been amazing.</p>\n<p>Halfway through the week, one volunteer had the idea to encourage students to write letters to their past selves about how healthy hygiene habits have positively impacted their lives.</p>\n<p>The results, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngageLab/status/1144672196889124874\">which we shared to wrap up our social media coverage of the campaign</a>, were moving. Reading in their words how good hygiene enables them to pursue the things that make them happy reminds us what makes this project so unique, and so important.</p>\n<p>Everyone — no matter who they are or where they live — deserves access to the resources and information that will help them live long, healthy lives.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/1_-qxRn9GjxP_ggqWQlopOxQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We’d like to thank everyone who helped us spread the word about #BeatGermsWithBheem across social media throughout the campaign!</p>\n<p>This weeklong campaign may be over, but we’ll keep spreading healthy hygiene habits to communities across India and the world. We’re continuing to reach out to NGOs and government agencies across India to spread the project and hygiene education for all!</p>\n<p>To learn more about Hygiene with Chhota Bheem, you can <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/hygiene/?en=\">check out the project’s new website</a>, check out our most recent updates <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/hygiene_with_chhota_bheem\">on our Linktree</a>, or download the mobile game for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hygiene-with-chhota-bheem/id1423871069?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.engagementlab.chhotabheem&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a>.
