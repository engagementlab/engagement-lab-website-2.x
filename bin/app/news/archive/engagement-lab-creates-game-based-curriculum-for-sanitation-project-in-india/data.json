The curriculum was developed in partnership with Green Gold Animation, the Indian Red Cross Society, the Mary Anne Charity Trust, and and a Working Group of NGOs and civil society groups dedicated to improving sanitation and hygiene in Tamil Nadu. It was playtested over several months with primary school children in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p><strong>vimeo</strong>:\n<a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/254534935\"><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/681708072_1280.jpg\" alt=\"vimeo\"></a>\nSee footage of Hygiene with Chhota Bheem game play.</p>\n<p>Hygiene with Chhota Bheem shows children videos featuring <em>Bheem</em>, the protagonist of a popular Indian animated children’s TV series. Following Bheem’s lead, children work to defeat an evil Germ Wizard that loves to spread germs and filth in the community. Children engage in interactive classroom activities that are based on the stories, and they play a digital mobile game that reinforces learning goals. At the end of each lesson, teachers give children a challenge to complete before the next week to defeat the Germ Wizard, such as making soapy water bottles and teaching friends about what they learned.</p>\n<p>From January 22nd–26th, <strong>Eric Gordon, Executive Director of the Engagement Lab and Professor at Emerson College,</strong> and <strong>Mary Beth Dawson, Project Manager at the Engagement Lab,</strong> visited Tamil Nadu to train teachers to implement the hygiene and sanitation curriculum. The curriculum is being tested with nearly 3,000 primary school children in a 30-school pilot study in Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_iO_WTpYlwJXTTBt6.png\" alt=\"Children practice washing their hands after learning how to make soapy bottles and how to properly wash hands with soap.\"></p>\n<p>Teachers will implement <strong>Hygiene with Chhota Bheem</strong> for four weeks in February 2018. The Mary Anne Charity Trust (MACT) has partnered with the Engagement Lab to conduct surveys and observations of toilets and handwashing stations at participating schools at baseline and two weeks after the curriculum has ended. “Evaluating <em>Hygiene with Chhota Bheem</em> in this pilot study will help us understand if the curriculum is effective in generating learning and behavior change among children,” said Dawson.</p>\n<p>According to Professor Gordon, “<em>Hygiene with Chhota Bheem</em> combines digital game play with immersion in a fantasy story world where kids get to play the hero coming to the aid of the public’s health. Our study seeks to test the effectiveness of games and storytelling not only on kids’ knowledge of hygiene and sanitation, but on their ability to advocate for change in their communities.”</p>\n<p>Learn more about the project <a href=\"https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/hygiene-with-chhota-bheem\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&gt; 1.
