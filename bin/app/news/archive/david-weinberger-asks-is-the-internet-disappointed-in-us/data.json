People can’t interact with the paper, can’t ask for shortcuts, can’t search for traffic density. Unlike smartphones or tablets; unlike the beauty of Internet.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_OhqI1U39g9ksVGq2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He spoke for about 2 hours, followed by a Q&amp;A session. The talk explained how his generation perfected ice cream and how the current one must perfect the Internet — must fight for its survival, its continuous improvement, and to ensure that it remains free and not hijacked by corporate pricing policies.</p>\n<p>Weinberger, who has been published in a variety of journals including <em>Wired</em>, CNN.com, and <em>The Atlantic</em>, says the Internet has the power to shape us.</p>\n<p>Many students who attended the talk mentioned that this was a refreshing change. A man coming in to tell them that no, the Internet isn’t evil, it is not killing everyone’s soul — in fact, it is quite the opposite.</p>\n<p>The Internet helps connect people, lets them share ideas and link to events across the globe. A hashtag can spark a revolution or help people in times of need (1). The current generation, Weinberger said, has a responsibility to make sure that there are no more unnecessary laws with regards to the Internet. It was, is, and must always remain, free.</p>\n<p>(1) Molly McHugh, “After Paris Attacks, Parisians Use Hashtag to Offer Shelter,” November 13, 2015, Wired.com, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/11/paris-attacks-parisians-use-porteouverte-hashtag-to-seek-offer-safe-shelter/\">http://www.wired.com/2015/11/paris-attacks-parisians-use-porteouverte-hashtag-to-seek-offer-safe-shelter/</a></p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"__typename":"Blog"}},"loading":false,"networkStatus":7,"stale":false}}
