From workshops on learning to engage across cultures, borders and divides to DIY Biotechnology, we’ve gathered an exciting lineup of presenters to share strategies, insights and approaches for collectively re-imagining public life in Boston.</p>\n<p>The conference includes keynote presentations by <strong>Nettrice Gaskins</strong>, whose work examines how cultural art and technology made by under-represented groups for creative expression and STEAM learning can ignite our civic imagination, and <strong>Mariama White-Hammond,</strong> an ecological justice minister who will draw upon her former experiences of social-justice media making with youth to inspire new narratives.</p>\n<p>Spearheaded by the Engagement Lab, <a href=\"http://bostoncivic.media\">Boston Civic Media</a> is a faculty-led network that aims to advance the transdisciplinary domain of civic media research and pedagogy in the Greater Boston Area. Each year, Boston Civic Media convenes its growing network of faculty, students, activists, journalists, policymakers and nonprofits all invested in “civic media,” or media that creates social change through art, design, and technology.</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:700px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_700/v1//homepage-2.0/news/medium/0_pEP52qSnDr-08iVc.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This year, our conference will also tackle the wicked problem of climate adaptation and preparedness throughout the City of Boston by releasing the first ever inter-campus curriculum addressing climate change.</p>\n<p>All are welcome to attend!
