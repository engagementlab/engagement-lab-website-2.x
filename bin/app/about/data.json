{"about":{"data":{"allAboutPages":{"summary1":{"html":"<p>The Engagement Lab was founded in 2010 as part of the Visual and Media Arts department at Emerson College to explore how creativity and the arts could reshape the institutions governing public life. Through the speculative lens of new and emerging technology, we asked: Who could participate in public life? How should they participate? And what are the political costs of non-participation?</p>\n<p>For more than ten years, the Engagement Lab’s faculty, students, and staff have worked with communities and organizations all over the world to explore the role of games, virtual reality, data visualization, artificial intelligence, and storytelling of all sorts, in achieving a more just society. We embrace collaborative design methods in all that we do, and highlight the power of working with those closest to problems to imagine and realize desirable outcomes.  </p>\n<p>Today, we offer a masters degree in “Media Design” and an undergraduate minor in “Social Impact Design,” and have focused our curriculum on Emerson’s local communities of Boston and Los Angeles. We organize and facilitate classes across the College’s disciplines and work with dozens of partners to create truly dynamic classroom experiences for our students and partners alike. </p>\n","__typename":"Markdown"},"image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/about/ivdlvdtsbznv7qedb8eo","__typename":"Image"},"__typename":"About"},"allPartners":[{"name":"Boston Public Library","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/oiyn3z20nzbz5k7gq9fy","__typename":"Image"},"url":"","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Boston Public Schools","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/eebpd6yju5pksdvw5sju","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Boston Uncornered","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/clbmmrn5e6suu1uocunk","__typename":"Image"},"url":"https://uncornered.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Brigham and Women's Hospital","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/ujbga6sdjmsil6cijul4","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.brighamandwomens.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Cape Cod Commission","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/ctzndahfpmi5glog5bx0","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.capecodcommission.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Citi Foundation","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/ul8nbxmmye6ba7p3txj8","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.citigroup.com/citi/foundation/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"City of Boston","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/c1bsggndkn1lrv2todmf","__typename":"Image"},"url":"","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Decordova Museum","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/zjhmqnijzbhpu95jndlx","__typename":"Image"},"url":"","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Detroit Works Project ","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/t1agrdaoirafal2xulmq","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.dcdc-udm.org/projects/strategies/dwltp/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/siqsj5jcembcapzydzs3","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.dsni.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"FHI360 ","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/mfhbqmzxk1svhwddtosz","__typename":"Image"},"url":"http://www.fhi360.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Knight Foundation","image":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/listings/jhmzhkofafipvibt2mkr","__typename":"Image"},"url":"","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Living Cities","image":{"public_id":"site/listings/jzdsrrv6hopd5y5zdgog","__typename":"Image"},"url":"https://www.livingcities.org/","__typename":"Partner"},{"name":"Louis D.
